# Calls for Papers

## About

Calls for Papers shows you the latest calls for papers of academic journals in your discipline.

Calls for papers for special issues in academic journals are currently published in several different locations.
For example, calls for papers are distributed on mailing lists, on publisher websites, at conferences, and through personal networks.
With several academic journals in a discipline and even more special issues, it can be incredibly difficult to keep track of calls for papers.

**Calls for Papers solves this problem by collecting calls for papers and making them easily accessible in one location.**
