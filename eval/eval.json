In its original conceptualization, DSR has been popularly characterized as research that “created and evaluates IT artifact intended to solve identified <em>organizational problems</em>” (Hevner et al., 2004, p. 77, emphasis added). More broadly, there is a recognition that DSR leads to artifacts that “serve human purposes” (March and Smith, 1995, p. 253). In particular, DSR can serve as an approach to tackle many of the wicked problems facing society today, including poverty, health, environmental degradation, climate change, disinformation, and terrorism.</p>\n<p>This special issue targets DSR that addresses societal problems. In particular, we encourage submissions linked to any of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) identified by the <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\">United Nations</a>, as well as work dealing with technologies that are transforming the world in which we live, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent studies in Decision Support Systems (DSS) have notably contributed to SDGs, spanning from enhancing healthcare quality (e.g., Ojo et al., 2024) to optimizing resource efficiency (e.g., Ge et al., 2024). Storey et al. (2024) emphasized the significance of integrating human-AI synergies in sociotechnical DSS design. Transparency is pivotal in advocating responsible DSR practices and design artifacts (Hevner et al., 2024).</p>\n<p>Recent DSR publications reflect a growing consensus within the community regarding the imperative to advance sustainable development. Strobel, et al. (2023) leveraged AI to translate sign language and improve participation of individuals with hearing difficulties in social activities. Wass, Thygesen, and Purao (2023) designed and deployed information systems to promote the social inclusion of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. With both DSR projects, the authors improved access to quality healthcare and equality. Other examples focus on promoting ecological sustainability, such as Schoormann, Stadtländer, and Knackstedt (2022) and Seidel, et al. (2018). Pan, et al. (2021) conducted an Action Design Research to support wildlife management for the purpose of environmental protection.</p>\n<p>Examples such as these demonstrate the promise of DSR as a research paradigm for tangible societal impacts. With this special issue, we hope to encourage fellow design science researchers to create even greater impacts together.</p>\n<p><strong>Themes of the Special Issue</strong></p>\n<p>This special issue aims to curate and present state-of-the-art design science research on topics related to delivering social good through the design and deployment of information systems. Although conceptual and methodological papers in this vein are welcome, the focus of this special issue on exemplars of DSR.

AI has been incorporated into digital business strategies, including applications such as expert systems, machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, machine vision, or speech recognition (Bornet et al., 2021; Collins et al., 2021). Implementation of AI-powered technologies such as service robots, chatbots, smart speakers, and other intelligent assistants already deliver new services (Borges et al., 2021) and increasingly interact with customers in the frontline (Gursoy et al., 2019; Wirtz et al., 2018) in various sectors such as banking (e.g., Flavián et al., 2022), hospitality and tourism (e.g., Schepers et al., 2022; Dwivedi et al. 2023b), or healthcare (e.g., Wirtz et al., 2021). AI is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, according to the levels proposed by Huang and Rust (2018), includes not only mechanical but also analytical, intuitive, and empathetic skills. As a result, the implementation of AI in business is transforming the marketplace (Bock et al., 2020) and affecting decision-making (Akdim et al., 2023; Duan et al., 2019). GenAI is expected to accelerate these developments.</p>\n<p>From a company perspective, AI implementation can generate value via process automation, improved decision-making, and customer engagement (Borges et al., 2021; Wirtz et al., 2023a). Therefore, the success of AI initiatives is based on their expected benefits, for example, customer experience, service quality, and productivity (Wirtz et al., 2021). However, previous studies have also noted that users can experience not only benefits, but also costs derived from the interaction with AI applications (Puntoni et al., 2021; Wirtz et al., 2023b). Similarly, the use of AI in business strategy still holds several open questions (Borges et al., 2021). Therefore, it is not surprising that previous studies have suggested that the development of new AI applications presents many challenges (Dwivedi et al., 2021; Belk, et al. 2023; Mariani et al., 2023).</p>\n<p>Similarly, recent advances in the field of AI (e.g., generative AI) offer not only new opportunities but have also raised several concerns (e.g., Mustak et al. 2023). GenAI produces new content in the form of human-like discourse (Wong et al., 2023), and the use of GenAI models and systems is becoming widespread. ChatGPT, which is probably the most well-known GenAI tool, generates personalized responses to users’ messages or questions based on the user input (Dwivedi et al., 2023a). GenAI may have great implications for business practice (Peres et al., 2023) in several sectors, such as banking (Dwivedi et al., 2023), travel and tourism (Wong et al., 2023), or health care (The Lancet Regional Health-Europe, 2023), as well as in activities such as marketing and management (Dwivedi et al., 2023a; Kshetri et al., 2023). Therefore, there is a need to understand GenAI applications and their positive and negative consequences for consumers, companies, and the society.</p>\n<p>In addition, previous literature has identified several ethical implications (e.g., related to fairness, privacy, security, etc.) in the context of AI use (Ashok et al., 2022; Wirtz et al., 2023b) that still require further analysis from several perspectives.</p>\n<p>In summary, the widespread use of GenAI across domains offers opportunities and challenges that need to be effectively understood to take full advantage of its benefits. It also requires implementing measures to mitigate the possible negative effects associated with its potential risks and threats. This dual approach will ensure that the adoption of GenAI remains aligned with ethical, practical and sustainable standards, thereby enabling greater innovation, efficiency, and positive change.</p>\n<p><strong>Potential illustrative research questions</strong></p>\n<p>This special issue invites proposals focused not only on the challenges and opportunities, but also on the risks and threats associated with the widespread use of GenAI.</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunities and challenges</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the effect of using GenAI and other new AI applications in business practices? Are there differences across industries and sectors (e.g., banking, hospitality and tourism, healthcare)?</li>\n<li>What are the main challenges and long-term benefits of using GenAI and other new AI applications in the contexts of teaching, academic research, and business practice?</li>\n<li>How can GenAI and other new AI applications be used to address global challenges (e.g., Sustainable Development Goals)?</li>\n<li>What are the main determinants and barriers to consumers’ and managers’ adoption of GenAI and other new AI applications? How does the use of GenAI and other new AI applications affect customer and manager decision making?</li>\n<li>How can GenAI contribute to personalization and efficiency in the communication and advertising processes?</li>\n<li>How does the use of GenAI and other new AI applications affect the different stages of the customer journey (e.g., pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase)? How can GenAI and other forms of AI improve the customer or user experience?</li>\n<li>How might reliance on GenAI enhance or limit human creativity and critical thinking in different fields?</li>\n<li>How can specific individuals (e.g., people with disabilities) benefit from the use of GenAI and other new AI applications?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Risks and threats</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the key digital ethical issues (e.g., fairness, biases, privacy, security) caused by the use of GenAI and its algorithms? How could these ethical issues be mitigated?</li>\n<li>How can the use of GenAI applications for manipulation of the public opinion and consumer decision making be reduced or even avoided?</li>\n<li>How is GenAI and other new AI applications affecting the labor market? Will employees be replaced by GenAI and how?</li>\n<li>How might differences in access to and use of GenAI exacerbate social and economic inequalities?</li>\n<li>What are potential contextual conditions (e.g., country and organizational cultures) that shape how individuals and organizations use GenAI and other new AI applications?</li>\n<li>What challenges do GenAI applications pose for existing legal and regulatory frameworks, and how might legal frameworks be developed to address GenAI-related risks?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expected types of analysis and context of study</strong></p>\n<p>We welcome submissions focused on varied sectors and environments (e.g., healthcare, education, banking, hospitality, and tourism). We especially welcome papers that include multiple studies (combining at least two studies to overcome the limitations of a quantitative cross-sectional analysis), longitudinal studies, and studies that employ mixed methods (combining qualitative and quantitative).

However, previous studies have also noted that users can experience not only benefits, but also costs derived from the interaction with AI applications. Similarly, the use of AI in business strategy still holds several open questions. Therefore, it is not surprising that previous studies have suggested that the development of new AI applications presents many challenges.",
                "Similarly, recent advances in the field of AI (e.g., generative AI) offer not only new opportunities but have also raised several concerns. GenAI produces new content in the form of human-like discourse, and the use of GenAI models and systems is becoming widespread. GenAI may have great implications for business practice in several sectors, such as banking, travel and tourism, or healthcare, as well as in activities such as marketing and management. Therefore, there is a need to understand GenAI applications and their positive and negative consequences for consumers, companies, and the society.",
                "In addition, previous literature has identified several ethical implications (e.g., related to fairness, privacy, security, etc.) in the context of AI use that still require further analysis from several perspectives.",
                "In summary, the widespread use of GenAI across domains offers opportunities and challenges that need to be effectively understood to take full advantage of its benefits. It also requires implementing measures to mitigate the possible negative effects associated with its potential risks and threats. This dual approach will ensure that the adoption of GenAI remains aligned with ethical, practical and sustainable standards, thereby enabling greater innovation, efficiency, and positive change."

Investigating the negative effects of technology at the customer interface</b></h3><p><p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS FOR A SPECIAL ISSUE ON</strong></p>\n<p><em>More supportive or more distractive? Investigating the negative effects of technology at the customer interface</em></p>\n<p>Over the past decades, a vast array of technologies has been introduced in the marketplace to improve the customer experience, leading to stimuli-dense consumption environments (Pantano, Pedeliento, Christodoulides, 2022). Such digital transformation has replaced and supplemented traditional face-to-face consumer interactions with digital-enabled assistants (i.e., apps to automatically locate products in stores, self-serve checkout, or to explore cities without a tourism guide). More recently, as a response to COVID-19, many new technologies were launched to limit consumers’ and service personnel’s exposure to the virus. For instance, in hospitality, new technologies like service robots helped reduce guest interactions with employees and enhance cleanliness (Shin and Kang 2020). Furthermore, the hospitality industry is increasing its use of AI in the form of intelligent voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) to support tourists from hotel room services to travel planning (Loureiro et al., 2021). In retailing, robots and self-service systems have been introduced to points of sale to facilitate contactless or in-home shopping (e.g., new apps to automatically find the products and pay in the store, or new delivery modalities based on drone technology), and AR and VR to improve consumer engagement with products and the shopping experience (Sung et al., 2021). On the one hand, these technologies safeguard consumers’ health and safety (Rahman et al., 2022a). On the other hand, they compensate for the unavailability of human workers, thus providing more automated experiences that could stimulate satiation (Pala et al. 2021). However, incorporating new technologies (e.g., VR, AR, AI) into today’s consumption experiences could have both positive (e.g., escapism, convenience, efficiency) and negative (e.g., binge watching, isolation, frustration, visually induced motion sickness, well-being) impacts on consumers, and broader society (Nanda &amp; Banerjee 2020; Dwivedi et al., 2022).</p>\n<p>Past research has largely emphasized the benefits of adopting technologies as decision support aids for consumers (Japutra et al., 2021). However, these technologies also influence human-to-human interactions, which lead companies to change their marketing communication strategies in reaching customers (e.g., shift to digital influencers) (Mishra et al. 2021; Hollebeek et al. 2021; Torres et al. 2019); while dramatically changing the nature of relationship experiences (Pera &amp; Viglia 2016), atmospherics (Roggeveen et al. 2020), and the way consumers process and integrate information between the offline and online environments (Rahman et al., 2022b; Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, Kotler and colleagues (2017) described how new technology might change consumers from being informed to becoming distracted. In this sense, technology in the consumption experience may consume too much of a customer’s attention by requiring them to focus on the system where there are many tasks, complex features, unfamiliar or unresponsive user interfaces. Arguably, customer interaction with technology may potentially reduce individual perception of atmospherics or other environmental stimuli, particularly when these are below the consciousness threshold. Thus, technology might move from being a supporting tool for customer to being a distractive mechanism for inhibiting purchase decision-making. For instance, in a luxury store setting, technology may distract prospects from opportunities to interact with employees through which they may learn more about the history, heritage, craftmanship and excellent quality of the product. In other cases, technology is a beneficial facilitator that allows deep access to luxury services or products that would not otherwise be attainable (Christodoulides et al. 2021). Similarly, if tourists’ attention is focused on a mobile app showing the best route to reach a certain attraction, s/he might ignore other tourist attractions on their travel journey. This dual nature of technology is unevenly researched in extant literature. Specifically, the distractive and negative effects of technology at the customer interface are still scarcely investigated and understood. This is a pertinent issue given the importance of new technology developments and innovations aligning to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prescribed by the UN, including responsible consumption and production in society (Dwivedi et al., 2022). Therefore, this Special Issue will address the interplay between a customer’s experience with technology and its associated distracting mechanisms, as triggered by their interaction with technology in varied consumption contexts. Conceptual, methodological, qualitative, or quantitative contributions that offer insight in this area are equally welcome by the Guest Editors. The Special Issue would accept papers focusing on topics including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>persuasion attributes and characteristics of supporting customer facing technology vs distracting technology</li>\n<li>mindful approaches for mitigating the distractive and negative effects of technology in consumption experiences (i.e., sensory overload, technostress, motion sickness, frustration, compulsive use, dehumanization and depersonalization of service/tourist experiences, consumer well-being)</li>\n<li>supporting VS distracting technology effects in consumption experiences such as retailing, tourism, services, luxury brands</li>\n<li>incorporating VS reducing multiple sensory cues in customer facing technology with brand experiences</li>\n<li>technology impacts on the threshold of consumer consciousness, and resulting impacts on consumer behaviour</li>\n<li>negative technology impacts on visual attention of consumers towards atmospherics and other environmental brand stimuli within consumption experiences</li>\n<li>consumer responses (cognitive, affective and behavioral) to technology distraction in consumption contexts</li>\n<li>technostress and the relevant negative effects on consumer decision making and their well-being</li>\n<li>the impact of technology distraction on bottom line measures</li>\n<li>the impact of technology distraction on consumers’ post-experience regrets</li>\n<li>the effect of technology distraction on consumers’ perceived brand image/authenticity of luxury brands, services and tourism experiences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All manuscripts that address these and/or related issues will be considered by the Special Issue Guest Editors, Dr. Eleonora Pantano (email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:e.pantano@bristol.ac.uk\">e.pantano@bristol.ac.uk</a>), Dr. Jamie Carlson (email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jamie.carlson@newcastle.edu.au\">jamie.carlson@newcastle.edu.au</a>), Dr. Konstantina Spanaki (email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:kspanaki@audiencia.com\">kspanaki@audiencia.com</a>), and Prof. George Christodoulides (email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:gchristodoulides@aus.edu\">gchristodoulides@aus.edu</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Deadlines</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Manuscript Submission Deadline:&nbsp;</strong>February 1st 2023</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>Christodoulides G., Athwal N., Boukis A. &amp; Semaan R.

Whilst data availability and access used to be a major challenge for information systems (IS) research, the current abundance of big data has now resolved this considerably. The theoretical building blocks of IS research come mainly from management theory, organization theory, behavioural theory, computer science theories, and systems theory (Barki, Rivard and Talbot, 1993). Apart from the core computer science theories, the other related theories enable IS researchers to explain how users interact with technology artefacts within individual, organizational, social, and political contexts and the impact of such interaction. Theory building, however, seems to have been disrupted by the current trends in big data-driven research, whereby the essence of contributing to theory is increasingly seen to be lacking at all levels of analysis. Concurrently, big data-driven research may inspire contributions towards design science and action research, whereby innovative solutions may also be created which help to define ideas, capabilities, practices, and innovative products or services through big data analysis (Angelopoulos et al., 2020; Hevner et al., 2004).</p>\n<p>While big data-driven studies are increasingly gaining popularity within IS research, they rarely introspect why a phenomenon is better explained by a theory and limit the analysis to what is happening by merely mining relevant data. Many such studies try to collect data and showcase applications of data science and visualization of unstructured, large volumes of data by demonstrating sentiment analysis, text mining, networks, and communities, without significant contribution to the theoretical context within which the problem is situated (Grover, 2020). Such studies do not attempt to explain why a particular phenomenon is witnessed and the data descriptions rarely contributes towards theory building. Thus, such studies have a weak connection with the relevant theories and IT artefacts, paying greater attention to data collection and analysis (Grover et al., 2020). Furthermore, since the data collection is often dated, such studies lose timeliness and do not attempt to explain causality (Grover, 2020).</p>\n<p>This special issue intends to facilitate theory-focused research, based on the analysis of big data as outlined in the directions provided in a recent opinion paper published in the journal (see Kar and Dwivedi, 2020). We specifically seek for theory building attempts in addressing grand individual, organizational, social or political problems. In particular, studies should demonstrate ample representative elements of big data such as high volume, velocity, variety, variability, veracity, visualization, and leading to value in understanding the phenomenon under examination. Authors need to explain why a phenomenon is happening rather that what is happening. The connection with IT artefacts must be significantly strong, while studies on emerging technologies are also of interest. Units of analysis could be individuals, groups or organizations. Of particular interest are theories explaining the nature of interaction among entities from more than a single unit type. Further, studies which mine more than a single type of unstructured data, and multi-methodology studies are also of interest, provided they contribute to theory building.

                "The availability of and access to big data has changed, as digital transformation initiatives are increasingly maturing globally, assisted by the growth of computational capabilities (Grover et al., 2020). Whilst data availability and access used to be a major challenge for information systems (IS) research, the current abundance of big data has now resolved this considerably. The theoretical building blocks of IS research come mainly from management theory, organization theory, behavioural theory, computer science theories, and systems theory (Barki, Rivard and Talbot, 1993). Apart from the core computer science theories, the other related theories enable IS researchers to explain how users interact with technology artefacts within individual, organizational, social, and political contexts and the impact of such interaction. Theory building, however, seems to have been disrupted by the current trends in big data-driven research, whereby the essence of contributing to theory is increasingly seen to be lacking at all levels of analysis. Concurrently, big data-driven research may inspire contributions towards design science and action research, whereby innovative solutions may also be created which help to define ideas, capabilities, practices, and innovative products or services through big data analysis (Angelopoulos et al., 2020; Hevner et al., 2004).",
                "While big data-driven studies are increasingly gaining popularity within IS research, they rarely introspect why a phenomenon is better explained by a theory and limit the analysis to what is happening by merely mining relevant data. Many such studies try to collect data and showcase applications of data science and visualization of unstructured, large volumes of data by demonstrating sentiment analysis, text mining, networks, and communities, without significant contribution to the theoretical context within which the problem is situated (Grover, 2020). Such studies do not attempt to explain why a particular phenomenon is witnessed and the data descriptions rarely contribute towards theory building. Thus, such studies have a weak connection with the relevant theories and IT artefacts, paying greater attention to data collection and analysis (Grover et al., 2020). Furthermore, since the data collection is often dated, such studies lose timeliness and do not attempt to explain causality (Grover, 2020).",
                "This special issue intends to facilitate theory-focused research, based on the analysis of big data as outlined in the directions provided in a recent opinion paper published in the journal (see Kar and Dwivedi, 2020). We specifically seek for theory building attempts in addressing grand individual, organizational, social or political problems. In particular, studies should demonstrate ample representative elements of big data such as high volume, velocity, variety, variability, veracity, visualization, and leading to value in understanding the phenomenon under examination. Authors need to explain why a phenomenon is happening rather than what is happening. The connection with IT artefacts must be significantly strong, while studies on emerging technologies are also of interest. Units of analysis could be individuals, groups or organizations. Of particular interest are theories explaining the nature of interaction among entities from more than a single unit type. Further, studies which mine more than a single type of unstructured data, and multi-methodology studies are also of interest, provided they contribute to theory building. Data could potentially be extracted from platforms like social media, communication networks, text-based data, images, multi-media, online communities, application-based data, sensor-based data, location-based data, data from smart-phones, smart devices and wearables. Other sources would also be welcome as long as the studies contribute theoretically.

Like past non-digital examples such as the steam engine or the electric motor, current emerging digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, 5G, 3D printing, smart manufacturing and energy, genomics and precision medicine, drones, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles are transforming markets and societies, as well as the very core of how we organize (Bohn et al., 2023). These and other technologies generate such an impact because they are increasingly ‘autonomous’ and ‘intelligent’, which complements, augments, and even replaces human action (Bailey et al., 2022; Gümüsay et al., 2023). Another feature fueling the transformative potential of emerging digital technologies is their connectivity – devices are interwoven in ways previously unthinkable (Adner et al., 2019). In addition, many current emerging digital technologies exhibit broad applicability across domains (Gambardella et al., 2021; Teece, 2018). They are thus general-purpose technologies (Bresnahan &amp; Trajtenberg, 1995) and in many cases advance to essential infrastructures across markets (Bohn et al., 2020). Finally, many of these emerging technologies exhibit an unprecedented pace of diffusion and adoption. Notably, OpenAI's ChatGPT reached one million users in a mere 5 days – compared with the several decades it took for non-digital innovations like the telephone to gain a similar level of user adoption.</p>\n<p>Building on a rich tradition in innovation theory (Jon &amp; Delbecq, 1977; Tushman &amp; Anderson, 1986) and organization studies (Child &amp; Mansfield, 1972; Daft, 1978), scholars have examined the interplay of emerging digital technologies and organizing on multiple levels. Across levels, it has been argued to put relations center stage, thus conceptualize emerging digital technologies as being made of relations and entwined in relations that are constantly evolving (Bailey et al., 2022; Reischauer &amp; Hoffmann, 2023). In addition, an emerging stream of research perceives the link between emerging digital technologies and organizations as sociomaterial where the social and the material are intertwined and mutually influence each other (Glaser et al., 2021; Moser et al., 2021; Orlikowski &amp; Scott, 2023).<br>At the industry level, institutional theory has emerged as an important lens to explain large-scale changes of enterprise systems, firms, and societies related to emerging digital technologies (Berente et al., 2019; Burton-Jones et al., 2020; Gegenhuber et al., 2022a; Hinings et al., 2018). One set of studies has shown that, in order to promote emerging digital technologies, organizations redefine and work institutions by championing standards (Garud et al., 2002; Vasudeva et al., 2014). Others have shown that the meaning and scope of these technologies was shaped by boundary work interwoven with field-configuring events (Liao, 2016). Recent advances point out that these organizational efforts to promote and shape emerging digital technologies can result in redefined institutional infrastructure (Gegenhuber et al., 2022a; Gegenhuber et al., 2022b; Logue &amp; Grimes, 2022). Shaping institutions to push emerging digital technologies has also been shown to be important to navigate large scale crises such as the COVID19 pandemic (Faik et al., 2020; Gkeredakis et al., 2021; Oborn et al., 2021).</p>\n<p><br>Focusing on the role of relationships between organizations and other forms of organizing for emerging digital technologies and thus the inter-organizational level, scholars have shown how members of social movements and (online) communities draw upon fluid sets of these technologies to coordinate collective action across regional boundaries (Braccini et al., 2019; Gümüsay et al., 2022; Leong et al., 2020; Young et al., 2019) and to mobilize digital technologies to connect and cultivate markets for social impact and investment (Logue &amp; Grimes, 2022). Moreover, studies found that, to assess their potential impact, organizations set up cross-industry cooperation that enabled an open learning climate, prevented intrafirm power struggles, and rendered the development of ‘common sense’ unnecessary due to a focus on parallel perspectives on potential impacts (Gattringer et al., 2021). Likewise, there are first indications of the relevance of meta-organizations for emerging digital technologies (Berkowitz &amp; Bor, 2017; Reischauer et al., 2021). Meta-organizations (or boundary organizations) are legally autonomous organizations that coordinate different organizations following a system-level goal (Gulati et al., 2012; Perkmann &amp; Schildt, 2015). Consider “Farm of the Future” where researchers, farmers, and agencies co-develop digital agricultural solutions to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture.</p>\n<p><br>Studies situated at the (intra-)organizational level identified distinct structures and management innovations that co-evolve with technologies as to profit from and implement them (Akhlaghpour &amp; Lapointe, 2018; Bohn et al., 2023; Kapoor &amp; Klueter, 2021; Khanagha et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2008; van Doren et al., 2022). Moreover, attention of managers to these technologies and multiple initiatives in different units are key to secure sufficient resources to the technology and to enable experimental learning (Khanagha et al., 2017).</p>\n<p><br>Despite these advances, we yet don’t have an in-depth understanding of the interrelated processes, structures, and practices through which people, collectives, organizations, and other forms of organizing push these technologies forward and, even more interestingly, try to push back. Specifically, there is a need for studies explore the various ways that organizations – alone or by collaborating with others – organize for and around constantly evolving emerging digital technologies on and across various levels. In addition, we need to better understand how organizations attempt to hinder certain emerging digital technologies in their further development or cope with the failure of collectively backed emerging technologies – such as 3D television or augmented reality glasses.<br>To overcome these limits, this special issue aims to create a forum for state-of-the-art research on the processes, structures, and practices of organizing for and against emerging digital technologies across levels. We invite different types of conceptual and empirical work situated in various contexts, including but not limited to for-profit organizations, public administration, politics, and social movements. Given the potential impact of emerging digital technologies, we especially welcome empirical work situated in critical infrastructure sectors (such as food and agriculture, healthcare, energy, water, waste, communications sector, and information technology).</p>\n<p>Recognizing the multifaceted nature of emerging digital technologies, we invite submissions that span a spectrum of approaches, from focused information systems studies to interdisciplinary research integrating insights from management, sociology, psychology, law, and other relevant fields. Next, we provide a non-exhaustive list of questions that would be of interest for this special issue.<br>● What are the affordances of emerging digital technologies and how do actors within and beyond organizational boundaries navigate them?<br>● How do organizations orchestrate individual and collective resources to push (and push back) emerging digital technologies?<br>● Which actors shape institutions in which ways to impact the evolution of emerging digital technologies in socially innovative and positive ways?<br>● Which forms of institutional complexity and infrastructure push and hold back emerging digital technologies?<br>● How do organizations utilize social evaluations to (not) drive emerging digital technologies?<br>● How do organizations create and re-direct discourses to push or inhibit emerging digital technologies?<br>● How do organizations and communities of practice respond to changed expectations tied to emerging digital technologies?<br>● How do organizations create desirable futures for themselves and their field that position emerging digital technologies center stage?<br>● How are emerging digital technologies utilized and their path impacted in the face of crisis?<br>● How are these technologies leveraged to impact the natural environment in positive ways?<br>● How do organizations employ emerging digital technologies to engage with societal grand challenges?<br>● How do enterprise systems change or are leveraged to navigate the tensions of emerging digital technologies?<br>● How is the implementation of emerging digital technologies impacted by different organizational structures (e.g., degree of formalization) and governance modes (e.g., contractual, relational)?<br>● What paradoxes do organizations and their members face when organizing for and against emerging digital technologies and how do they navigate these paradoxes successfully?<br>● How do members of organizations and established forms of organizing (e.g., local communities, online communities) mobilize others to (not) take a stand for emerging digital technologies?<br>● What is the role of meta-organizations in promoting or inhibiting emerging digital technologies?<br>● What collaboration processes support meta-organizations for emerging digital technologies and how do they relate to the processes of member organizations?<br>● How do third parties (e.g., competitors, policy makers, media) respond to and shape organizational efforts directed at emerging digital technologies?</p>\n<p><strong>Manuscript submission information:</strong></p>\n<p>Regular submission to Information and Organization, as well as submissions to the Research Impact and Contributions to Knowledge (RICK) section will be considered.

                "Organizations of the 21st century face a seemingly indeterminable array of emerging digital technologies, which are radically novel and rapidly evolving, with profound transformative potential. Current emerging digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, and more, are transforming markets and societies, as well as the very core of how we organize. These technologies generate such an impact because they are increasingly ‘autonomous’ and ‘intelligent’, complementing, augmenting, and even replacing human action. Another feature fueling the transformative potential of emerging digital technologies is their connectivity. Many current emerging digital technologies exhibit broad applicability across domains and are thus general-purpose technologies and advance to essential infrastructures across markets.",
                "Building on a rich tradition in innovation theory and organization studies, scholars have examined the interplay of emerging digital technologies and organizing on multiple levels. Across levels, it has been argued to put relations center stage, thus conceptualizing emerging digital technologies as being made of relations that are constantly evolving. An emerging stream of research perceives the link between emerging digital technologies and organizations as sociomaterial where the social and material are intertwined and mutually influence each other. At the industry level, institutional theory has emerged as an important lens to explain large-scale changes of enterprise systems, firms, and societies related to emerging digital technologies.",
                "Despite these advances, we yet don’t have an in-depth understanding of the interrelated processes, structures, and practices through which people, collectives, organizations, and other forms of organizing push these technologies forward and, even more interestingly, try to push back. Specifically, there is a need for studies exploring the various ways that organizations organize for and around constantly evolving emerging digital technologies on and across various levels."

How has the meaning and definition of creativity evolved over time?  What historical inflection points are there that resemble the one we are faced with today? What might we learn from the history of creativity?    </li>\n<li><em>Accountability of computer creativity:</em> When a product/service is designed by an algorithm (e.g., Dreamcatcher designing a chair), where does accountability for failure lie? What are the legal and ethical implications of analytical/computational creativity? </li>\n<li><em>Creativity as an (efficient) search problem:</em> What algorithms are the most effective when a creative task is approached as a search problem?  Under what conditions (e.g., decision parameters/constraints; process cost criteria) is one search algorithm better than its closest rivals?  </li>\n<li><em>Approaches to analytical creativity:</em> How should a designer select among the different approaches to/tools for analytical creativity? How do the outcomes differ? Under what conditions is one approach superior to others?</li>\n<li><em>Human-Algorithm collaboration in creative tasks:</em> Under what conditions is human-algorithm cooperation in creativity superior (e.g., in terms of innovation/output, tangible and intangible process costs) to algorithmic-only or human-only creativity? What are the critical success factors of human-algorithm creative tasks? </li>\n<li><em>Human replicable artificial creative intelligence:</em> Innovation methods that do not rely on innate ability and can lead to replicable innovation results when used by different innovators. Can methods that are generalizable and applicable to many domains (such as TRIZ, Logical Creativity Theory) be developed?</li>\n<li><em>Role of neuroscience in creativity research:</em> The IS field has explored neuroscientific techniques in the last decade (e.g., Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis 201; Riedl et al. 2020). Can a neuroscientific approach lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism of creativity (of a specific task), via experimental and/or computational research (Abraham 2018)? Can it generate artificial analytical creative models that can achieve human empathy (for example, via perception of trustworthiness based on visual and audio signals)?</li>\n<li><em>Levels of analysis:</em> Are creative tasks decomposable into self-contained units, each of which can be solved by a logical process?</li>\n<li><em>Institutional level creativity:</em> Can we develop processes that organizations can use to ensure creativity that is not dependent on any specific individual?</li>\n<li><em>Application of creativity:</em>  What are important and critical problems that need creative solutions? What value is attributed to creativity in different application domains, e.g., entertainment vs. education vs. NGOs focused on major social issues including poverty reduction, food security and clean energy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Review Process</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>We will strive to ensure the quality, fairness, timeliness, and objectivity of the reviews. The associate editors, in consultation with the editors, will flag the papers where reviewers’ assessments differ significantly. The associate editor will compile the reviews anonymously and share with the reviewers for possible reconsideration by the reviewers to achieve reasonable consensus. The associate editor may choose to provide an opportunity for the authors to anonymously communicate with the reviewers to seek or provide clarification. Regardless of whether consensus is reached or not, the associate editors will make recommendations in light of all the feedback, and the editors will make the final decisions. </p>\n<h4>Associate Editors and Editorial Review Board</h4>\n\n<h6>Associate Editors (alphabetical order)</h6>\n<p>Yifan Dou, Fudan University, yfdou@fudan.edu.cn\n<br>Fred Feinberg, University of Michigan, feinf@umich.edu\n<br>Guodong Gao, Johns Hopkins University, gordon.gao@jhu.edu\n<br>Natalia Levina, New York University, nlevina@stern.nyu.edu \n<br>Mingfeng Lin, Georgia Institute of Technology, mingfeng.lin@scheller.gatech.edu\n<br>Aron Lindberg, Stevens Institute of Technology, aron.lindberg@stevens.edu \n<br>Vincent Mak, University of Cambridge, v.mak@jbs.cam.ac.uk\n<br>Oded Netzer, Columbia University, onetzer@gsb.columbia.edu\n<br>Susan Scott, London School of Economics and Political Science, s.v.scott@lse.ac.uk\n<br>Inbal Yahav Shenberger, Tel Aviv University, inbalyahav@tauex.tau.ac.il\n<br>Anjana Susarla, Michigan State University, asusarla@broad.msu.edu\n<br>Demetrios Vakratsas, McGill University, demetrios.vakratsas@mcgill.ca\n<br>Harry Wang, University of Delaware, hjwang@udel.edu\n<br>Lior Zalmanson, Tel Aviv University, lzalmanson@tauex.tau.ac.il\n</p><h6>Editorial Review Board (alphabetical order)</h6>\n<p>Mehmet Eren Ahsen, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, ahsen@illinois.edu\n<br>Michel Avital, Copenhagen Business School, ma.digi@cbs.dk\n<br>Mads Boedker, Copenhagen Business School, mb.digi@cbs.dk\n<br>Hai Che, University of California, Riverside, hai.che@ucr.edu\n<br>Yi Ding, University of Warwick, y.ding.1@wbs.ac.uk\n<br>Felix Eggers, Copenhagen Business School, fe.marktg@cbs.dk\n<br>Dominik Gutt, Erasmus University, gutt@rsm.nl\n<br>Irina Heimbach, WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management, irina.heimbach@whu.edu\n<br>Hye-Jin Kim, KAIST, hyejinkim@kaist.ac.kr\n<br>Hyeokkoo Eric Kwon, Nanyang Technological University, eric.kwon@ntu.edu.sg\n<br>Pan Li, Georgia Institute of Technology, pan.li@scheller.gatech.edu\n<br>Tianyi Li, Chinese University of Hong Kong, tianyi.li@cuhk.edu.hk\n<br>Tian Lu, Arizona State University, lutian@asu.edu\n<br>Arjun R, Vellore Institute of Technology, arjun.r@vit.ac.in\n<br>Kariyushi Rao, University of Warwick, kariyushi.rao@wbs.ac.uk\n<br>Andreas Richter, University of Cambridge, a.richter@jbs.cam.ac.uk\n<br>Scott Schanke, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, schanke@uwm.edu\n<br>Jochen Schlapp, Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, j.schlapp@fs.de\n<br>Thomas Scholdra, University of Cologne, scholdra@wiso.uni-koeln.de\n<br>Wen Wang, University of Maryland, College Park, wenw@umd.edu\n<br>Hongchang Wang, University of Texas at Dallas, hongchang.wang@utdallas.edu\n<br>Marlon Twyman, University of Southern California, marlontw@usc.edu\n<br>Yifan Yu, University of Texas at Austin, yifan.yu@austin.utexas.edu\n<br>Li Xiao, Fudan University, lixiao@fudan.edu.cn\n<br>Niam Yaraghi, University of Miami, niamyaraghi@miami.edu\n<br>Juheng Zhang, University of Massachusetts, Lowel, Juheng_Zhang@uml.edu\n<br>Shunyuan Zhang, Harvard Business School, szhang@hbs.edu\n<br>Cameron Kormylo, Virginia Tech, ckormylo@vt.edu\n\n<br>\n</p><h4>Projected Timeline</h4>\n<p><b><font color=\"red\">Updated December 22, 2023</font></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Paper Submission: February 29, 2024</li>\n<li>First Round of Editorial Decisions: June 15, 2024</li>\n<li>Workshop at University of Warwick: August 2024</li>\n<li>Revisions Due: October 30, 2024</li>\n<li>Second Round of Editorial Decisions: January 31, 2025</li> \n<li>Final Revisions Due: March 28, 2025</li>   \n<li>Final Editorial Decisions: May 30, 2025 </li></ul><br> \n<br> \n\n<h4>References</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Abraham, A., 2018. <em>The Neuroscience of Creativity</em> (Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience in Psychology) </li>\n<li>Altshuller, G., 1984. <em>Creativity as an Exact Science</em>.

These include natural and human-caused disasters. The former encompass geophysical (e.g., earthquakes), hydrological (e.g., floods), climatological (e.g., wildfires), meteorological (e.g., cyclones), or biological (e.g., disease epidemics such as COVID-19) disasters. The latter are caused by human-led events, such as conflicts, famine, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity incidents, and industrial accidents (IFRC 2010). A myriad of factors has contributed to a surge in disasters: technological innovation, population growth, climate change, demographic changes, and evolving social dynamics. When they happen, such disasters exact a devastating toll on civil and technical infrastructure and society as a whole (e.g., loss of human life, social and economic disturbances, and environmental damage). </p>\n<p>In extreme cases where natural and human-caused disasters join forces, the suffering of victims often increases exponentially. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 has added a new threat to refugees and humanitarian resettlement programs (CDC 2020). The International Rescue Committee (2020) commented that “People in refugee camps in Syria, Greece and Bangladesh face a heightened risk of COVID-19 due to more densely populated conditions than even the Diamond Princess—the cruise ship where transmission of the virus was four times faster than in Wuhan.” </p>\n<p>Worldwide, government agencies, private sectors, and the public are in desperate search for new tools, practices, and strategies to safeguard society against the threat of disasters (Chen et al. 2013; Park et al. 2015). For policy makers, Information technology (IT) has been considered important in enabling and supporting efficient and effective disaster management. In recognition of the potential role of IT, as early as 2007, the United States Congress followed the E-government Act of 2002 to direct the National Research Council to study the application of IT to disaster management. Over the past decade, the world has seen an increasing level of IT use in modern disaster management (Beydoun et al. 2018). Examples include blockchain for disaster logistics, wearable technologies for rescue teams and victims, remote monitoring sensors for intelligence gathering, virtual reality for response preparedness and training, GIS for crisis mapping, social media for disaster information dissemination and extraction of real-time intelligence, and big data for impact assessment and forecasting. Such IT uses have been found across the globe. </p>\n<p>Management of disasters is challenging for its multi-phase, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder, multi-task, multi-objective nature. First, disaster management follows multiple phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In the example of the preparedness phase, efforts are taken to develop a single- or all-hazard disaster plan, evaluate and modify the plan, exercise the plan (e.g., table-top exercises or drills), and stock inventory (e.g., water and food). These phases are interconnected as the performance of one response phase affects that of the next phase. Second, disaster management calls for different specialties and strategies in response to various disaster types, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass shootings, earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, hurricanes, and train derailments. For example, management of pandemic and terrorist attacks focus on responding to and containing a disaster after its appearance (i.e., reactionary), whereas floods and hurricanes necessitate proactive mitigation strategies in anticipation of the disaster. Third, disaster management involves a broad stakeholder approach, potentially encompassing international coalitions (e.g., the U.N.), local government, public safety and security (e.g., Fire, Police, and Hazmat), logistics providers, public health and medical services, humanitarian / social society organizations, military, transportation, utility and public works, donors, media, and business/civilian victims. While these stakeholders might agree on the general principle of social good, their exact goals and objectives might vary (Abbasi et al. 2019). Fourth, disaster management handles a wide range of operations, such as unified command, situational assessment, coordinated operations, risk assessment (Tinsley et al. 2011; Dillion and Tinsley 2008), impact analysis, resource allocation, victim assistance, supply chain and logistics, and financing. Fifth, disaster management works to achieve objectives such as preserving lives and properties, containing the impact, protecting the health and safety of response personnel, safeguarding the natural environment, sustaining business and civilian activities, protecting critical infrastructures, informing the public, and restoring and rebuilding affected communities. Finally, disaster management consists of mitigation of harm in the disaster context, which may include examination of harms and harm quantification, tracing the impact of harm and identifying susceptible population, and dissemination of harm.</p>\n<p>To help policy makers, IT can provide strategic support that addresses each aspect of disaster management. In the example of multi-stakeholder support, IT can be used to interconnect stakeholders for building response partnerships. In doing so, it is also important to avoid IT misuse which may create digital chaos and impede first responders and other offline disaster management activities; for instance, human- or bot-led propagation of false information on social media. The security and privacy issues of IT use surrounding disaster management is also an important consideration. Compared with other disciplines (e.g., Management Science), scholars in IS have been relatively silent about disaster management – new findings on the proper design, use, and management of IT can undoubtedly have a huge real-world impact. IS research in disaster management may be performed at multiple levels: individual, organizational, and social. Different methods, such as qualitative, quantitative, data science, and design science can all contribute to building a stronger body of knowledge.

        "rawContent": "## JAIS Special Issue Call for Papers \n\n# Digital Sustainability and Information Systems Research: \n\n# New challenges and theoretical perspectives \n\nSustainability is a moral and existential imperative of our time. As Information Systems (IS) scholars, we are aware of the immense impact of digital technologies on efforts and initiatives towards sustainable practice happening locally and globally. Furthermore, because digital phenomena lie at the heart of our discipline, IS researchers are well positioned to join these efforts. This Special Issue aims to champion new _digital sustainability_ research programs targeting the planet’s most pressing sustainability challenges from the past decade. We hope it will contribute towards building novel collective knowledge and help shape digital sustainability research in IS. **Motivation for this Special Issue** Human society is approaching the edge of a dangerous precipice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report unequivocally confirms that human activities have caused global warming, predicting that even with current commitments and mitigation efforts, it will be difficult to limit warming below the critical threshold of 2oC (IPCC, 2023). The planet’s air, land, and water continue to be threatened on several fronts, with research suggesting that the safe operating zone for six of the nine planetary boundaries has already been breached (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.). Over the past decade, extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, fires and heatwaves have not only increased in frequency but also in magnitude. In addition to causing environmental impacts, these events have a significant impact on society, further complicating the pursuit of social and economic sustainability. In 2020, about 724 million people were living in conditions of extreme poverty, with almost 30% of the world’s population suffering from some level of food insecurity (United Nations, 2023). Equality for women and other marginalized groups continues to lag. The World Bank (2022) reports that 2.4 billion women globally do not have the same economic rights as men, and despite the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 (United Nations, 2007), Indigenous Peoples around the world continue to suffer the intergenerational trauma of colonization. The trend towards urbanization endures, with cities struggling to ensure inclusive, resilient, and sustainable living environments for all residents (United Nations 2023). On top of all these challenges, violent conflicts have led to the forced migration of millions of people and the deaths of thousands of civilians (United Nations 2023). These alarming circumstances highlight the lack \n\n\nof progress towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. As stated in the 2023 Progress Report ,the promise of leaving no one behind is in peril: of 140 measured targets, only 12% are on track for 2030, and about half are moderately or severely off track. In response to the urgent need to address sustainability challenges, organizations, governments and industries worldwide have started to make efforts in recent years to harness the potential of digital technologies. Examples of such efforts range from specific solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors widely used by many organizations to pursue sustainability objectives, to the birth of new data-driven companies that are applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer sustainability-related data services. This harnessing of digital technologies to address sustainability challenges has impacted the way practitioners view this emerging trend, which they increasingly refer to as _digital sustainability_. For example, Gartner describes digital sustainability as harnessing the “tools of digital transformation, such as enhanced connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT), to improve the environment and support sustainable business operations”. On a global scale, the United Nations has initiated conversations on the relationship between digital sustainability and environmental concerns. For example, the focus of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is “accelerating and scaling environmental sustainability by applying data, digital technologies, and solutions to UNEP’s key activities, products, and services and ultimately delivers on its key action areas— climate, nature, and pollution _”(UN Environment Programme, n.d.). In the domain of social sustainability,_ the United Nations chosen theme of “ _DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality_ ” for International Women’s Day 2023 emphasizes the potential of digital technologies for empowering women and girls. However, IS research has been lagging behind the digital sustainability discourse happening in practice. As argued in a recent JAIS editorial on digital sustainability (Kotlarsky et al., 2023), the IS research community has a strong foundation to draw upon (Watson et al., 2020), ranging from research into Green IS (e.g., Leidner et al. 2022; Watson et al. 2021; Corbett & Mellouli, 2017) to studies addressing significant societal challenges (e.g., Tong et al. 2022; Young et. al. 2019; Young 2018; Tim et al. 2017, Puri 2007). As Urquhart and her colleagues (2008) note, the poor cannot eat technology, but the mindful design and use of technology can contribute to innovative solutions and positive impacts. In particular, we consider that the recent shift in the way IS research approaches digital phenomena offers new perspectives on the relationship between _digital technologies_ and _sustainability._ Building on Baskerville et al.’s (2020) contention that the classical view of an information system as representing and reflecting physical reality has become obsolete, we agree that an ontological reversal has taken place at the junction between technology and sustainability whereby the digital version of business solutions is created first (e.g., algorithms and data analytics solutions) and the physical version second (e.g., material waste) (Kotlarsky et al. 2023). As a result, the assumption that IS only represents the physical assets within sustainability phenomena is being challenged. This provides an opportunity for the IS community to drive a more inclusive agenda on digital sustainability, one that encompasses phenomena in which the impact of digital technologies and macro-level environmental, social, and economic objectives converge. Accordingly, this Special Issue seeks contributions that delve into _digital sustainability_ and encompass “ _the development, deployment, and utilization of digital resources and artifacts toward improving the environment, society, and economic welfare”_ (Kotlarsky et al. 2023, p. 938)_._ \n\n\n**What we are interested in** We invite original and thought-provoking studies that advance and shape our understanding of digital sustainability as an emerging research area. We are interested in studies that contribute to our understanding of environmental and/or social sustainability, and studies that elucidate new forms of digital sustainability. We therefore welcome studies that engage with digital sustainability by building on theoretical foundations from the extant IS literature, as well as studies that bring insights from other disciplines into the IS research domain. Furthermore, we seek studies that consider digital sustainability at all levels and perspectives, in the context of developing and developed nations. We specifically welcome submissions that integrate more than one dimension of digital sustainability—the environment, society, and/or economic welfare. Overall, we aim to present a collection of papers that provides a balanced, integrated, and cumulative perspective on digital sustainability. **Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to:** **_Design and development considerations_** \n\n- Research that investigates the processes, principles, resources or capabilities required \n\n## for the design and development of digital sustainability artefacts \n\n- Intervention-based research that engages directly in enhancing sustainability practices \n\n## within organizations or communities through effective leveraging of digital technologies \n\n- Studies that examine how the different inter- and intra-organizational actors involved in \n\n## digital sustainability projects engage and interact as they develop, deploy, and govern \n\n## digital solutions for macro-level sustainability agenda \n\n- Explorations of the relationship(s) between digital objects and the physical reality they \n\n## shape/create in the context of social and environmental sustainability \n\n**_Use considerations_** \n\n- Research that examines how digital technologies support key organizational activities \n\n## (e.g., decision-making, resource management, and innovation processes) in the \n\n## management of macro-level sustainability challenges, such as climate change \n\n- Theoretical and/or empirical investigations of the interplay between sustainability \n\n## initiatives and other digital agendas, such as digital transformation \n\n- Studies of ‘computed human experiences’ with respect to sustainability, for example, \n\n## how people interact with complex environmental and social problems through \n\n## immersive technologies \n\n- Research on the challenges and opportunities for reclaiming and rejuvenating \n\n## Indigenous cultures and knowledge as well as advancing Indigenous community \n\n## economic development through decolonized digital artefacts \n\n\n**_Management and governance considerations_** \n\n- Studies that explore the governance of digital sustainability and new ways of organizing \n\n## for sustainability in different settings. For example, where do digital sustainability \n\n## initiatives emerge and how do they unfold? \n\n- Research on the role of different actors in the digital sustainability ecosystem and their \n\n## impact on the emergence of new digital sustainability sectors and business models \n\n- Studies on the sustainability agenda at the community and societal levels, and the role \n\n## of digital technologies in either empowering or constraining sustainability-driven \n\n## collective actions \n\n- Policy implications related to digital sustainability for organizations, individuals, and \n\n## societies, especially as they relate to ethical concerns and social well-being \n\n**_Outcomes and consequences_** \n\n- Studies that incorporate multiple aspects of digital sustainability performance to enrich \n\n## and expand our understanding of the impact of digital technologies on various \n\n## stakeholders \n\n- Case studies and other investigations of real-world impacts (positive/negative, \n\n## planned/unintended) of digital sustainability on vulnerable or marginalized communities \n\n- Given that the well-being of future generations is a central concern, research that \n\n## investigates alternative ways of measuring progress toward long-term sustainability \n\n## objectives and how to link these with short-term performance \n\n- Beyond techno-optimism, identifying the key challenges presented by digital \n\n## technologies, either directly or through their use, that negatively impact sustainability \n\n## agendas, coupled with empirical insights for mitigating these challenges \n\n**What we are not interested in** We are not interested in studies that only make peripheral contributions to digital sustainability. This may be the case when the original research design, including the data collected, was not intended to contribute to understanding of digital sustainability, or when engagement with the concept of digital sustainability is marginal. A possible example of the latter would be studies that append a connection to one or more Sustainable Development Goals as a post-hoc discussion, yet the core research problem is not substantially driven by a sustainability issue. Given that this Special Issue aims to promote research programs that relate to the planet’s most pressing sustainability challenges, we believe that environmental and social welfare are of utmost importance. Therefore, we are not interested in studies concerned solely with economic welfare at the business level, such as those on sustainable business operations or organizational sustainability. We do, however, welcome submissions that couple economic welfare with other dimensions, such as environmental or social welfare, especially when integrated within a broader, macro-level sustainability agenda. \n\n\nWe also emphasize that while related to digital responsibility (AIS, 2023) and digital resilience (Boh et al., 2023), digital sustainability differs from these notions. Therefore, we are ONLY interested in studies on digital sustainability. We recommend potential authors consult the recent editorial on digital sustainability by Kotlarsky et al. (2023), which provides a conceptualization and extensive discussion of digital sustainability and its ontological foundations. \n\n## Dates \n\n## 1 9/20 February \n\n## 2024 \n\n## Online information session (we invite potential authors to send us \n\n## specific questions to address during this session) \n\n## 2 October 2024 Deadline for paper submission \n\n## 1 February 2025 First-round decisions \n\n## 1 June 2025 Deadline to submit revised papers \n\n## 15 September \n\n## 2025 \n\n## Second-round decisions \n\n## 1 February 202 6 Deadline to submit revised papers \n\n## 1 June 202 6 Provisional/Final decisions \n\n## 1 July 202 6 Deadline to submit final paper (if minor revision is required) \n\n**Special Issue Guest Editors** Julia Kotlarsky – University of Auckland, New Zealand Jacqueline Corbett Université Laval, Canada Juliana Sutanto – Monash University, Australia Thomas Kude – University of Bamberg, Germany Yenni Tim – University of New South Wales, Australia **Special Issue Guest Editors Bios** \n\n## Julia Kotlarsky (j.kotlarsky@auckland.ac.nz) is a Professor of Information Systems at the University of \n\nAuckland Business School, New Zealand.

                "Sustainability is a moral and existential imperative of our time. As Information Systems (IS) scholars, we are aware of the immense impact of digital technologies on efforts and initiatives towards sustainable practice happening locally and globally. Furthermore, because digital phenomena lie at the heart of our discipline, IS researchers are well positioned to join these efforts. This Special Issue aims to champion new digital sustainability research programs targeting the planet’s most pressing sustainability challenges from the past decade. We hope it will contribute towards building novel collective knowledge and help shape digital sustainability research in IS.",
                "Motivation for this Special Issue Human society is approaching the edge of a dangerous precipice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report unequivocally confirms that human activities have caused global warming, predicting that even with current commitments and mitigation efforts, it will be difficult to limit warming below the critical threshold of 2°C (IPCC, 2023). The planet’s air, land, and water continue to be threatened on several fronts, with research suggesting that the safe operating zone for six of the nine planetary boundaries has already been breached (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.). Over the past decade, extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, fires and heatwaves have not only increased in frequency but also in magnitude. In addition to causing environmental impacts, these events have a significant impact on society, further complicating the pursuit of social and economic sustainability. In 2020, about 724 million people were living in conditions of extreme poverty, with almost 30% of the world’s population suffering from some level of food insecurity (United Nations, 2023). Equality for women and other marginalized groups continues to lag. The World Bank (2022) reports that 2.4 billion women globally do not have the same economic rights as men, and despite the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 (United Nations, 2007), Indigenous Peoples around the world continue to suffer the intergenerational trauma of colonization. The trend towards urbanization endures, with cities struggling to ensure inclusive, resilient, and sustainable living environments for all residents (United Nations 2023). On top of all these challenges, violent conflicts have led to the forced migration of millions of people and the deaths of thousands of civilians (United Nations 2023). These alarming circumstances highlight the lack of progress towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. As stated in the 2023 Progress Report, the promise of leaving no one behind is in peril: of 140 measured targets, only 12% are on track for 2030, and about half are moderately or severely off track.",
                "In response to the urgent need to address sustainability challenges, organizations, governments and industries worldwide have started to make efforts in recent years to harness the potential of digital technologies. Examples of such efforts range from specific solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors widely used by many organizations to pursue sustainability objectives, to the birth of new data-driven companies that are applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer sustainability-related data services. This harnessing of digital technologies to address sustainability challenges has impacted the way practitioners view this emerging trend, which they increasingly refer to as digital sustainability. For example, Gartner describes digital sustainability as harnessing the “tools of digital transformation, such as enhanced connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT), to improve the environment and support sustainable business operations”. On a global scale, the United Nations has initiated conversations on the relationship between digital sustainability and environmental concerns. For example, the focus of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is “accelerating and scaling environmental sustainability by applying data, digital technologies, and solutions to UNEP’s key activities, products, and services and ultimately delivers on its key action areas— climate, nature, and pollution.” In the domain of social sustainability, the United Nations chosen theme of “DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality” for International Women’s Day 2023 emphasizes the potential of digital technologies for empowering women and girls.",
                "However, IS research has been lagging behind the digital sustainability discourse happening in practice. As argued in a recent JAIS editorial on digital sustainability (Kotlarsky et al., 2023), the IS research community has a strong foundation to draw upon (Watson et al., 2020), ranging from research into Green IS (e.g., Leidner et al. 2022; Watson et al. 2021; Corbett & Mellouli, 2017) to studies addressing significant societal challenges (e.g., Tong et al. 2022; Young et. al. 2019; Young 2018; Tim et al. 2017, Puri 2007). As Urquhart and her colleagues (2008) note, the poor cannot eat technology, but the mindful design and use of technology can contribute to innovative solutions and positive impacts. In particular, we consider that the recent shift in the way IS research approaches digital phenomena offers new perspectives on the relationship between digital technologies and sustainability. Building on Baskerville et al.’s (2020) contention that the classical view of an information system as representing and reflecting physical reality has become obsolete, we agree that an ontological reversal has taken place at the junction between technology and sustainability whereby the digital version of business solutions is created first (e.g., algorithms and data analytics solutions) and the physical version second (e.g., material waste) (Kotlarsky et al. 2023). As a result, the assumption that IS only represents the physical assets within sustainability phenomena is being challenged. This provides an opportunity for the IS community to drive a more inclusive agenda on digital sustainability, one that encompasses phenomena in which the impact of digital technologies and macro-level environmental, social, and economic objectives converge. Accordingly, this Special Issue seeks contributions that delve into digital sustainability and encompass “the development, deployment, and utilization of digital resources and artifacts toward improving the environment, society, and economic welfare.”",
                "What we are interested in We invite original and thought-provoking studies that advance and shape our understanding of digital sustainability as an emerging research area. We are interested in studies that contribute to our understanding of environmental and/or social sustainability, and studies that elucidate new forms of digital sustainability. We therefore welcome studies that engage with digital sustainability by building on theoretical foundations from the extant IS literature, as well as studies that bring insights from other disciplines into the IS research domain. Furthermore, we seek studies that consider digital sustainability at all levels and perspectives, in the context of developing and developed nations. We specifically welcome submissions that integrate more than one dimension of digital sustainability—the environment, society, and/or economic welfare. Overall, we aim to present a collection of papers that provides a balanced, integrated, and cumulative perspective on digital sustainability.",
                "What we are not interested in We are not interested in studies that only make peripheral contributions to digital sustainability. This may be the case when the original research design, including the data collected, was not intended to contribute to understanding of digital sustainability, or when engagement with the concept of digital sustainability is marginal. A possible example of the latter would be studies that append a connection to one or more Sustainable Development Goals as a post-hoc discussion, yet the core research problem is not substantially driven by a sustainability issue. Given that this Special Issue aims to promote research programs that relate to the planet’s most pressing sustainability challenges, we believe that environmental and social welfare are of utmost importance. Therefore, we are not interested in studies concerned solely with economic welfare at the business level, such as those on sustainable business operations or organizational sustainability. We do, however, welcome submissions that couple economic welfare with other dimensions, such as environmental or social welfare, especially when integrated within a broader, macro-level sustainability agenda. We also emphasize that while related to digital responsibility and digital resilience, digital sustainability differs from these notions. Therefore, we are ONLY interested in studies on digital sustainability."

Later, in the 1970s, researchers developed more advanced models capable of producing more realistic and coherent outcomes (Amari, 1972 ). Contemporary GAI models are based on state-of-the-art neural network architectures (e.g., Heising & Angelopoulos, 2023). They combine such architectures to develop large models (e.g., Large Language Models, or LLMs) that outperform existing benchmarked ones (Forbes, 2023 ; Kushwaha and Kar, 2021). Contemporary GAI solutions, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023 a), DALL-E 2 (Ramesh et al., 2022), MidJourney (MD, 2023 ), and Stable Diffusion (Stable Diffusion, 2023 ), can therefore produce large amounts of contextual outputs on any specific topic. They are highly trained and sophisticated, enabling users to produce various types of AIgenerated content (e.g., audio, texts, videos, and images). Although GAI has been around for a while, recent developments have brought the potential of such solutions to the forefront. In particular, LLMs have the potential to transform the way we develop textual content and communicate with one another. In recent advances, transformer-based deep learning networks have been impressively effective for generating textual responses as outputs to cues from users based on LLMs (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Hence, in a way, the latest developments in GAI have increased its potential for use in a wide range of industries like healthcare, customer service, media, marketing, finance, biopharma among others. The ongoing discourse on GAI seems to extol the promises of AI (utopian visions of a world free of drudgery and want) and the dangers (dystopian visions of machines taking over the world). Such discourse is well chronicled for many technologies in the Gartner hype cycle. New technologies spawn overenthusiasm, followed by disillusionment and eventually enlightenment, as we learn how to use them. In every case, the technology is heralded as incredible, and predictions, both constructive and destructive, run rampant. _Our goal for this Special Issue is to offer a careful examination of the challenges faced in managing this powerful set of technologies for individuals, organizations, and society._ \n\n\nMany, but not all, of the challenges around GAI concern data. As per a Forbes report, over 90% of internet data will be produced by GAI models, triggering serious concerns about harmful and abusive content generation (IBM, 2023). To illustrate the challenge, most current GAI-triggered use involves chat-based digital assistants (Stokel-Walker and Noorden, 2023 ). While the outcome of GAI in these digital assistant-based applications is indeed remarkable, their effectiveness depends on the level of task specificity and the need for information synthesis. Also, both organizations and governments face challenges associated with policies of data protection and content moderation. Lately, the Italian government has temporarily limited the processing of personal data by OpenAI, thereby forcing OpenAI to block ChatGPT in that region (Italian Directive, 2023 ). OpenAI itself anticipated the potential applications by fraudsters, and released a feature that allows the users to apply a content filtering flag to potentially problematic content (Hacker et al., 2023; OpenAI 2023b). Organizations might have other challenges regarding data protection. For example, a computer manufacturer recently decided to adopt GAI and then transfer its knowledge base to GAI platforms to be able to provide users with actionable and custom responses. But in the process, these internal information assets of the firm became available in the data repository of the LLMs. \n\n## Call for Papers \n\nOur special issue is focused on challenges for individuals, organizations, and society to manage the use of GAI and the threats to individuals and society. The list below is illustrative (but not exhaustive) of the themes we solicit for the special issue: At the individual level, a number of challenges exist on how to effectively use GAI to augment individual productivity. For instance, how can GAI-based interactions positively or negatively affect customer experiences, how can GAI augment (vs. replace) human skills, how can individuals assess the veracity of GAI-based communications, how can poorly designed interactions (prompts) adversely affect outcomes and broader questions of how over-reliance on GAI systems may adversely impact the cognitive inability of users and learners. At the organizational level, there are many challenges around governance. For instance, how can we govern the quality of content by GAI, which may have varying levels of diffusion among user communities, how can the adoption of GAI lead to disruption and even loss of internal data, knowledge, and trade secrets, how do we set up appropriate governance structures to manage GAI projects and ongoing GAI use, and how can we avoid unintended consequences of GAI adoption in firms? At the societal (and “macro-economic’) level, there are extensive challenges around misinformation, bias, and privacy. For instance, how can GAI in social media fight misinformation, what is the impact of GAI models on societal ethics, socio-cultural bias, and sociocultural well-being of users, how should GAI models be regulated to minimize cyber security risks (i.e., generate realistic fake data, commit fraud), how should society address privacy, given that GAI requires organizations to have access to huge volumes of high-quality data? \n\n\nOur broad goal for the special issue is to attract papers that articulate the challenges theoretically and study them empirically, while making a strong contribution to the theory (Struijk et al., 2022) and practice (Davison, 2022) in the deployment of GAI. We are not interested in pure methodological contributions. \n\n## Methodologies \n\nWe welcome a variety of research approaches, including but not limited to the following: \n\n- Conceptual/theoretical articles \n\n- Theory testing, including quantitative studies based on primary data (surveys,     experiments) and/or secondary data \n\n- Theory building, including qualitative studies based on expert interviews, and case     studies \n\n- Design science research, including user research on GAI artifacts implemented in     industrial applications. We welcome studies that combine several different research methodologies (mixed methods) and submissions that include both theoretical model building and validation. \n\n## Key Dates \n\n- Article Submission Deadline: 31st August, 2024 \n\n- First Review: 3 0th November, 2024 \n\n- Article Final Decision: 31st July, 2026 Articles will be screened for fit and quality by the SI Editors. Those that successfully go through the screening will be sent out for a full review. Guidelines for authors \n\n- Short Title for SI: Challenges of GAI \n\n- Submissions must follow the author guidelines of the journal: \n\n- SI submissions should be submitted through the journal’s review system. \n\n## Special Issue Editors \n\nVarun Grover George & Boyce Billingsley Endowed Chair and Distinguished Professor Walton College of Business, University of Arkansas, USA. vgrover@uark.edu Arpan Kumar Kar (Coordinating SI Editor) Professor and Chair Professor, Information Systems Group, Department of Management Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India. arpankar@iitd.ac.in , arpan_kar@yahoo.co.in \n\n\nRajiv Sabherwal Edwin & Karlee Bradberry Endowed Chair and Distinguished Professor Walton College of Business at University of Arkansas, USA. rsabherw@uark.edu Spyros Angelopoulos Associate Professor Durham University Business School, Durham University, UK Email: Spyros.Angelopoulos@durham.ac.uk Hartmut Hoehle Professor and Chair of Enterprise Systems, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany, hoehle@uni-mannheim.de Managing Editor: Anik Mukherjee, Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India.

            "paragraphs": [
                "The origins of generative AI (GAI) can be traced back to the 1950s, when Alan Turing proposed a test to determine whether a machine could be perceived as intelligent enough to generate responses to questions in a way indistinguishable from a human. Later, in the 1970s, researchers developed more advanced models capable of producing more realistic and coherent outcomes. Contemporary GAI models are based on state-of-the-art neural network architectures (e.g., Heising & Angelopoulos, 2023). They combine such architectures to develop large models that outperform existing benchmarked ones. Contemporary GAI solutions can therefore produce large amounts of contextual outputs on any specific topic. They are highly trained and sophisticated, enabling users to produce various types of AI-generated content. Although GAI has been around for a while, recent developments have brought the potential of such solutions to the forefront. In particular, LLMs have the potential to transform the way we develop textual content and communicate with one another.",
                "The ongoing discourse on GAI seems to extol the promises of AI (utopian visions of a world free of drudgery and want) and the dangers (dystopian visions of machines taking over the world). Such discourse is well chronicled for many technologies in the Gartner hype cycle. New technologies spawn overenthusiasm, followed by disillusionment and eventually enlightenment, as we learn how to use them. Our goal for this Special Issue is to offer a careful examination of the challenges faced in managing this powerful set of technologies for individuals, organizations, and society.",
                "Many, but not all, of the challenges around GAI concern data. To illustrate the challenge, most current GAI-triggered use involves chat-based digital assistants. While the outcome of GAI in these digital assistant-based applications is indeed remarkable, their effectiveness depends on the level of task specificity and the need for information synthesis. Also, both organizations and governments face challenges associated with policies of data protection and content moderation. Lately, the Italian government has temporarily limited the processing of personal data by OpenAI, thereby forcing OpenAI to block ChatGPT in that region.",
                "At the individual level, a number of challenges exist on how to effectively use GAI to augment individual productivity. For instance, how can GAI-based interactions positively or negatively affect customer experiences, how can GAI augment (vs. replace) human skills, how can individuals assess the veracity of GAI-based communications, and how can poorly designed interactions (prompts) adversely affect outcomes? At the organizational level, there are challenges around governance and the adoption of GAI. For instance, how can we govern the quality of content by GAI, how can the adoption of GAI lead to disruption and loss of internal data, and how can we avoid unintended consequences of GAI adoption in firms? At the societal level, there are extensive challenges around misinformation, bias, and privacy risks due to the need for organizations to access huge volumes of data."

Mason School of Business , William & Mary (rajiv.kohli@mason.wm.edu) \n\n**Extended Abstract (5-page) Submission Deadline: February 1, 2023** \n\n To be considered for this special issue, an extended abstract must be submitted via the JAIS Manuscript Central submission system by February 1, 2023 (please specify “Health Analytics and IS Theorizing” special issue in the cover letter when submitting). The abstract must be 5-pages maximum, single-spaced (12-point font), and will include an overview of the problem, data, method, and anticipated contribution(s). References are not included in the 5-page limit. We will be evaluating the abstract on fit and potential, not completed analyses. Selected extended abstract submissions will be invited to submit a full paper (see projected timeline and submission type specifics below). We encourage new and interesting work in health analytics and theory. \n\n**Objective:** \n\n The objective of this special issue is to showcase how health analytics can be used to enhance theorizing in the field of IS. In addition to its contribution to deep analysis, the power of health analytics research lies in theory development that leverages the unique context of health care. Specifically, the special issue aims to foster research that addresses the question: How can the application and design of analytics methods identify insights from health data and extend IS theory? This special issue places analytics at the forefront of IS research so that health care researchers can make a theoretical contribution to IS research. Through this special issue, we hope to provide an opportunity for emerging and innovative health analytics research to be published that will showcase how new forms and combinations of theoretical reasoning, methods, and data can contribute to theory building. \n\n\n**Anticipated Contributions:** \n\n Our hope is that this special issue will contribute to deeper descriptions, explanations, and predictions of emerging health phenomena relevant to IS scholars as well as demonstrate to clinicians and patients opportunities that will enrich health care management and delivery. We welcome research at the intersection of traditional and emerging approaches, exploratory research, phenomenon-based research, novel methods, and data from any relevant source (with IRB approval, as needed). While we are open to discoveries of all kinds, we expect application of rigorous methods, presentation of persuasive reasoning, and inclusion of strong evidence. Accepted papers will likely contribute in one or more of the following areas, within the context of health analytics: \n\n- Identification of new patterns or insights that challenge or refine existing     assumptions. \n\n- New (or new to IS) ways of blending the traditional and innovative (e.g.., causal ML). \n\n- More nuanced understanding of how investments in or use of health analytics can     solve societal or organizational resource allocation challenges. \n\n- Innovative use of disparate data sources, either directly from industry, from publicly     available sources, or combinations thereof. We are especially interested in innovative combinations of emerging phenomena, use of AI/ML methods, and insightful data sources. Preference will be given to submissions that showcase emerging and creative approaches to theoretical reasoning, research designs, methods, and/or data. For instance, we are especially interested in application of econometric + machine learning (e.g., EconML) methods to emerging data sources, toward the goal of providing more fine-grained theoretical insights. \n\n**Topics of Interest:** \n\n The special issue is open to any relevant topic at the intersection of health care and analytics that expands IS-related theory. Some examples are: \n\n1. Heterogenous treatment effects in areas such as health care performance, social     determinants of health, use of patient generated health data, and offering or pricing     of health care, pharmaceutical, medical device, or insurance products. \n\n2. AI/ML based tools that can reduce information asymmetry, improve decision-     making, or optimize information flows. \n\n3. Unstructured data analysis, such as of digital trace data, images, or user-generated     content, that yields insights about topical or trend dynamics. \n\n4. Impact of, or disparities in, health analytic capabilities or investments by hospitals,     clinics, or less frequently considered entities such as laboratories, pharmacies,     medical device manufacturers, public health agencies, or charitable organizations. \n\n\n5. Integration of personal device data to analyze trends, identify public health issues,     and efficacy of treatments. \n\n6. Any interesting or creative area we have yet to research in-depth in IS, such as topics     in genomics, signal processing/telemetry, clinical trials, or epidemiology. \n\n**Background and Significance:** \n\n Health analytics can be generally described as generating insights from health data through analysis. Significant and impactful work in health analytics is emerging in the IS literature (e.g., Bardhan et al., 2015; Bygstad et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2021; Kankanhalli et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Son et al., 2020), but there are also significant opportunities to leverage health analytics research to contribute to theorizing in IS. For instance, while interesting findings within IS have been presented in the context of health analytics use in hospitals (Bardhan et al., 2015; Bygstad et al., 2020) and clinical diagnostics or care (Fang et al., 2021; Son et al., 2020), many health analytics research contexts have yet to be exploited in IS research. In medical, health informatics, and data science literatures, the consideration of health analytics has been much more diverse. Studies have been conducted, for example, on how to apply ML toward a deeper understanding of substance abuse treatment disparities (Nasir et al., 2021), identifying latent topics associated with COVID-19 vaccine discussions on Twitter (Lyu et al., 2021), making connections between research disciplines during viral outbreaks (Powers-Fletcher et al., 2021), and optimal use of visualizations to reduce cognitive load and increase efficacy of health analytics output use by clinicians (Caban & Gotz, 2015). The diversity of data and contexts within which to conduct health analytics research is substantial and such diversity is currently underrepresented in IS journals. We propose that health analytics research can advance beyond presentation of context specific models and methods. For instance, we now know a lot more about how to effectively manage AI resources (Berente et al., 2021), how chronic disease information can be leveraged to improve outcomes (Bardhan et al., 2020), and how machine learning (Leavitt et al., 2021; Padmanabhan et al., 2022; Tremblay et al., 2021) and computational approaches (Berente et al., 2019; Miranda et al., 2022; Shrestha et al., 2021) can be leveraged for theory building. However, application of these innovative approaches to theory building with health analytics research is at a nascent stage. We see considerable promise in applying such innovative approaches to the enhancement of IS theory, particularly in explaining IS-enabled mechanisms, through research conducted in the health analytics context. \n\n**Submission Criteria:** \n\n Submissions to this special issue can be: \n\n- Research Articles (14,000 words or less; see JAIS Instructions for Authors for full     requirements), which must include theorizing and an empirical component. \n\n- Research Briefs (7,000 words or less) which must include an empirical component.     The theorizing may be more limited, or more inductive or abductive, if this is a new     phenomenon or approach. For this submission type, we suggest being guided by \n\n\n “phenomenon-based theorizing” (Gregory & Henfridsson, 2021; Von Krogh, 2018) or a related approach that supports early theory development. \n\n- Research Perspectives (8,000 words or less), which do not require an empirical     component but should “provoke exciting discussion” at the intersection of IS theory     and health analytics. For this submission type, please focus on an interesting area of     debate or tension. We encourage perspectives such as: free market vs. drug pricing     controls, data privacy vs. public good, mandatory vs. voluntary use of predictive (or     prescriptive) models in areas such as clinical decision making, risk adjustment, utility     vs. cost functions applied to patient behavior nudges, standard vs. heterogenous     treatment effects, inferential vs. ML approaches. Please submit through the JAIS Scholar One submission system and please _be sure to state that you are submitting to the “Health Analytics and IS Theorizing Special Issue” in the cover letter._ Please also be sure to _specify whether you are submitting a Research Article, Research Brief, or a Research Perspective_. There is no need to recommend a senior editor or editorial board member, as the guest editors of this special issue will handle all submissions. However, in your cover letter, please do list conflicts of interest with any of the special issue editorial board members. \n\n**Special Issue Editorial Board:** \n\n Corey Angst, University of Notre Dame Hilal Atasoy, Rutgers University Sezgin Ayabakan, Temple University Ofir Ben Assuli, Tel Aviv University, Israel Sangeeta Shah Bharadwaj, Management Development Institute, India Langtao Chen, Missouri University of Science and Technology Yichen Cheng, Georgia State University Anton Ivanov, University of Illinois Juhee Kwon, City University of Hong Kong Nakyung Kyung, National University of Singapore Shaila Miranda, University of Oklahoma Abhay Mishra, Iowa State University Sunil Mithas, University of South Florida Min-Seok Pang, Temple University Sujeet Sharma, Indian Institute of Management Tiruchirappalli, India Sriram Somanchi, University of Notre Dame Junbo Son, University of Delaware Ankita Srivastava, Bentley University Monica Tremblay, William & Mary Hongyi Zhu, The University of Texas at San Antonio \n\n\n**Projected Timelines and Process:** \n\n This special issue is organized to support a developmental process meant to help early-stage ideas progress.

The abstract must be 5-pages maximum, single-spaced (12-point font), and will include an overview of the problem, data, method, and anticipated contribution(s). References are not included in the 5-page limit. We will be evaluating the abstract on fit and potential, not completed analyses. Selected extended abstract submissions will be invited to submit a full paper (see projected timeline and submission type specifics below). We encourage new and interesting work in health analytics and theory.",
                "The objective of this special issue is to showcase how health analytics can be used to enhance theorizing in the field of IS. In addition to its contribution to deep analysis, the power of health analytics research lies in theory development that leverages the unique context of health care. Specifically, the special issue aims to foster research that addresses the question: How can the application and design of analytics methods identify insights from health data and extend IS theory? This special issue places analytics at the forefront of IS research so that health care researchers can make a theoretical contribution to IS research. Through this special issue, we hope to provide an opportunity for emerging and innovative health analytics research to be published that will showcase how new forms and combinations of theoretical reasoning, methods, and data can contribute to theory building.",
                "Our hope is that this special issue will contribute to deeper descriptions, explanations, and predictions of emerging health phenomena relevant to IS scholars as well as demonstrate to clinicians and patients opportunities that will enrich health care management and delivery. We welcome research at the intersection of traditional and emerging approaches, exploratory research, phenomenon-based research, novel methods, and data from any relevant source (with IRB approval, as needed). While we are open to discoveries of all kinds, we expect application of rigorous methods, presentation of persuasive reasoning, and inclusion of strong evidence. Accepted papers will likely contribute in one or more of the following areas, within the context of health analytics: Identification of new patterns or insights that challenge or refine existing assumptions. New (or new to IS) ways of blending the traditional and innovative (e.g., causal ML). More nuanced understanding of how investments in or use of health analytics can solve societal or organizational resource allocation challenges. Innovative use of disparate data sources, either directly from industry, from publicly available sources, or combinations thereof. We are especially interested in innovative combinations of emerging phenomena, use of AI/ML methods, and insightful data sources. Preference will be given to submissions that showcase emerging and creative approaches to theoretical reasoning, research designs, methods, and/or data. For instance, we are especially interested in application of econometric + machine learning (e.g., EconML) methods to emerging data sources, toward the goal of providing more fine-grained theoretical insights.",
                "Health analytics can be generally described as generating insights from health data through analysis. Significant and impactful work in health analytics is emerging in the IS literature (e.g., Bardhan et al., 2015; Bygstad et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2021; Kankanhalli et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Son et al., 2020), but there are also significant opportunities to leverage health analytics research to contribute to theorizing in IS. For instance, while interesting findings within IS have been presented in the context of health analytics use in hospitals (Bardhan et al., 2015; Bygstad et al., 2020) and clinical diagnostics or care (Fang et al., 2021; Son et al., 2020), many health analytics research contexts have yet to be exploited in IS research. In medical, health informatics, and data science literatures, the consideration of health analytics has been much more diverse. Studies have been conducted, for example, on how to apply ML toward a deeper understanding of substance abuse treatment disparities (Nasir et al., 2021), identifying latent topics associated with COVID-19 vaccine discussions on Twitter (Lyu et al., 2021), making connections between research disciplines during viral outbreaks (Powers-Fletcher et al., 2021), and optimal use of visualizations to reduce cognitive load and increase efficacy of health analytics output use by clinicians (Caban & Gotz, 2015). The diversity of data and contexts within which to conduct health analytics research is substantial and such diversity is currently underrepresented in IS journals. We propose that health analytics research can advance beyond presentation of context specific models and methods. For instance, we now know a lot more about how to effectively manage AI resources (Berente et al., 2021), how chronic disease information can be leveraged to improve outcomes (Bardhan et al., 2020), and how machine learning (Leavitt et al., 2021; Padmanabhan et al., 2022; Tremblay et al., 2021) and computational approaches (Berente et al., 2019; Miranda et al., 2022; Shrestha et al., 2021) can be leveraged for theory building. However, application of these innovative approaches to theory building with health analytics research is at a nascent stage. We see considerable promise in applying such innovative approaches to the enhancement of IS theory, particularly in explaining IS-enabled mechanisms, through research conducted in the health analytics context."

        "url": "https://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/SI-DigitalResponsibility.pdf",
        "rawContent": "**JAIS Special Issue Call for Participation Digital Responsibility: Social, Ethical, and Ecological Implications of IS Deadline for submission: 3 November 2023 Motivation for this Special Issue** Pervasive digitalization has influenced practically all aspects of the human experience and our institutions in business, society, and government. Diverse areas such as organizational management and strategy, urban affairs and city planning, healthcare, entertainment, safety, politics, and transportation have all been inexorably shaped by digital technologies. Such technologies have created non-trivial and nonreversible changes to our individual and collective behaviors (Kane et al., 2021), our institutions and organizations (Mihale-Wilson et al., 2022), as well as to human society and our planet at large (Elliott et al., 2021). But with great power also comes great responsibility. The transformational changes from digitalization are neither unequivocally positive nor negative; more often than not, they are laden with ethical tensions between the contrasting outcomes they engender. For example, personal data digitalization can help individuals live longer and healthier lives, but it also challenges individual rights, obligations, and our sense of dignity (Leidner & Tona, 2021; Tam et al., 2019). Social media allows us greater connectivity and access, upholding the democratic principle of collective voice (Oh et al., 2015), but also becomes a vehicle for manipulating public opinion (Kitchens et al., 2020) and spreading fake news and falsehood (King et al., 2021; Turel & Osatuyi, 2021). Emerging technologies such as shared electric vehicles are coining a revolution in the mobility and energy sector (Kahlen et al., 2018), but also increase fears of labor substitution (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). The datafication of everyday behaviors has led to new healthcare opportunities but also increased surveillance (De Moya & Pallud, 2020; Sjöström et al., 2022). The wide embracement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) propels new opportunities for automation and decision-making, but also raises thorny ethical issues in terms of accountability, privacy, fairness, discrimination, and further biases (Benbya et al., 2021; Berente et al., 2021). These observations surface the fact that digital technologies invoke competing narratives: the transformational and innovative powers of digital technologies (Benbunan-Fich et al., 2020; Nambisan et al., 2017; Wessel et al., 2021) often contrast dysfunctional outcomes of digitalization, such as social endangerment (Demetis & Kietzmann, 2021) or loss of human voice and autonomy (Demetis & Lee, 2018). \n\n\nWhile digital technologies promise an exciting future, we have been cautioned that “the journey to the fully pervasive digitized world is also likely to be perilous” and “as much as the potential benefits of digital technology are real, so too are the risks and complexity that ride with them” (Yoo et al., 2012, p. 1406). Therefore, the key question that we must ask is: _how can we positively leverage the transformational powers of digital technologies without falling prey to their possible dysfunctional outcomes?_ We believe that the answer to this complex question partly lies in the consideration of an important construct: _responsibility_. Responsibility allows us to evaluate transformational digital technologies in a balanced manner, by factoring in both harmful and positive outcomes from the engagement with such artifacts (Voegtlin et al., 2022). Responsibility has become a salient term in this digital age, inspiring new streams of research such as corporate digital responsibility (Lobschat et al., 2021; Mihale-Wilson et al., 2022) and responsible innovation (Ahuja et al., 2023). Forcing us to engage in meta-ethical reflection (Stahl, 2012) responsibility is crucial to addressing some of the dysfunctional outcomes associated with the rapid proliferation of digital technologies – thus allowing for normative action consistent with human values and ethical defensibility (Chatterjee & Sarker, 2013; Chatterjee et al., 2009a; Chatterjee et al., 2009b). As information systems researchers, it must be on us to better understand the concept of responsibility as it pertains to the enablement of positive outcomes of ongoing digitalization of our everyday lives while safeguarding the human experience against possible negative consequences of the same. We term this concept “digital responsibility”, which we believe can serve as an _organizing construct_ of research that aims to inform the balancing of ethical and humanistic tensions pertaining to the rapid proliferation of digital technologies. Notably, focusing on digital responsibility allows us to challenge the often-embraced utopic narrative of digitalization – thus problematizing our vision for this special issue. Digital responsibility is antithetical to “mindlessness” in designing and implementing digital technologies, which is often associated with the inability “to cope gracefully with changing, complex situations characteristic of high-risk domains” (Salovaara et al., 2019, p. 555). The lens of digital responsibility necessitates that we embark upon rigorously analyzing, explaining, predicting, as well as influencing, the potential costs, duties, and obligations of decisions that relate to the development, implementation, and use of digital information and communication technologies. Following such observations, unpacking the phenomenon of “digital responsibility” should be of utmost concern to IS researchers – and this is the central theme of this special issue. **What We Seek for this Special Issue We are interested** in novel, exciting, and thought-provoking contributions that build cumulative knowledge about “digital responsibility” across all levels (personal, corporate, institutional, and societal) and domains of responsibility (individual, social, ethical, and ecological). So as not to constrain the range of contributions, we suggest understanding digital responsibility broadly as any accountabilities, liabilities, responsibilities, obligations, and duties that relate to the design, development, implementation, use and impact of digital technologies. We deliberately do not limit the call to a specific domain, theoretical lens, or research approach. We are looking for contributions that contain a substantive IS perspective but may also feature interdisciplinary \n\n\napproaches (both theoretical and methodological). We also impose no constraints in terms of theory, method, paradigm, or context. We do not want labels and scripts associated with traditional IS paradigms, such as behavioral, design, economic, or organizational research, to constrain how this important and complex phenomenon is investigated. We welcome the entire spectrum of information systems research and invite innovative, rigorous, relevant, and exciting research on digital responsibility. We welcome empirical, design, as well as conceptual work, and we also welcome carefully crafted commentaries, research perspectives, or opinions. However, in every submission, the chosen research topic should be contemporary and relevant, speaking to current grand challenges of our time. **We are not** interested in papers that advance _methodological contributions_ even if they might have relevance to the study of digital responsibility. We also do not seek papers that advance our understand of _how_ to build theory about digital responsibility. Likewise, we are not interested in papers whose contributions about digital responsibility build on data that were not originally collected for that purpose. Finally, contributions in which digital responsibility is merely a by-product of some other contribution, however valuable, are also not what we are after. Potential topics of submissions include, but are not limited to: ▪ Designing and using digital technologies _for_ and _with_ responsibility ▪ Considerations of accountability, liability, fairness, and/or responsibility for digital technology design, implementation, and use ▪ Theoretical perspectives and/or empirical insights on the (un)intended social, ethical, and ecological consequences of digital technologies ▪ Theoretical underpinnings of the concept of digital responsibility, such as from an ethical theory perspective ▪ Design of digital technology to address social, ethical, and/or ecological challenges ▪ Individual, organizational, institutional, or societal strategies for leveraging IS for social, ethical, and/or ecological challenges and innovations ▪ The role of digital technology in promoting social, ethical, and ecological advancements ▪ Applications of emerging digital technologies (e.g., AI) to social, ethical, and/or ecological realms ▪ Societal, ethical, and ecological consequences of emerging digital technologies ▪ (Un-) ethical issues of IS and the data they generate ▪ Dignity, respect, and moral behavior in a digital world ▪ Social support and inclusion enabled by or embodied in digital technologies ▪ The balance of contradicting implications of IS (e.g., IS as a means for social change vs. IS for manipulating public opinion) ▪ The affordances of existing and emerging digital technologies for enacting digital responsibility **Process and Timeline** Submissions to the Special Issue will close on November 3, 2023. Prospective authors are encouraged to submit initial versions of their paper to the conference theme track “Digital Responsibility” of the 2023 “Wirtschaftsinformatik” Conference (Sep 18 21, 2023, Paderborn, Germany) but submission or \n\n\nparticipation at the conference is no requirement for submitting to the special issue. A paper development workshop will be held in May 2024 for authors of papers that advance beyond the first round of reviews. We plan for an in-person event but we will also make online participation possible. **Date Event** November 3, 2023 Deadline for paper submissions March, 2024 First-round review decisions May, 2024 Hybrid Paper development workshop July 11, 2024 Deadline for submission of revised papers October, 2024 Second-round review decisions December 8, 2024 Deadline for submission of revised papers Early February, 2025 Provisional decision and final round of comments February 27, 2025 Deadline for submission of revised^ papers March 2025 Notification of final decisions Submission to the special issue must be made via Scholarone and follow the JAIS submission guidelines.

            "paragraphs": [
                "Pervasive digitalization has influenced practically all aspects of the human experience and our institutions in business, society, and government. Diverse areas such as organizational management and strategy, urban affairs and city planning, healthcare, entertainment, safety, politics, and transportation have all been inexorably shaped by digital technologies. Such technologies have created non-trivial and nonreversible changes to our individual and collective behaviors, our institutions and organizations, as well as to human society and our planet at large. But with great power also comes great responsibility.",
                "The transformational changes from digitalization are neither unequivocally positive nor negative; more often than not, they are laden with ethical tensions between the contrasting outcomes they engender. For example, personal data digitalization can help individuals live longer and healthier lives, but it also challenges individual rights, obligations, and our sense of dignity. Social media allows us greater connectivity and access, upholding the democratic principle of collective voice, but also becomes a vehicle for manipulating public opinion and spreading fake news and falsehood. Emerging technologies such as shared electric vehicles are coining a revolution in the mobility and energy sector, but also increase fears of labor substitution. The datafication of everyday behaviors has led to new healthcare opportunities but also increased surveillance. The wide embracement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) propels new opportunities for automation and decision-making, but also raises thorny ethical issues in terms of accountability, privacy, fairness, discrimination, and further biases.",
                "These observations surface the fact that digital technologies invoke competing narratives: the transformational and innovative powers of digital technologies often contrast dysfunctional outcomes of digitalization, such as social endangerment or loss of human voice and autonomy.",
                "While digital technologies promise an exciting future, we have been cautioned that 'the journey to the fully pervasive digitized world is also likely to be perilous' and 'as much as the potential benefits of digital technology are real, so too are the risks and complexity that ride with them.' Therefore, the key question that we must ask is: how can we positively leverage the transformational powers of digital technologies without falling prey to their possible dysfunctional outcomes? We believe that the answer to this complex question partly lies in the consideration of an important construct: responsibility.",
                "Responsibility allows us to evaluate transformational digital technologies in a balanced manner, by factoring in both harmful and positive outcomes from the engagement with such artifacts. Responsibility has become a salient term in this digital age, inspiring new streams of research such as corporate digital responsibility and responsible innovation. Forcing us to engage in meta-ethical reflection, responsibility is crucial to addressing some of the dysfunctional outcomes associated with the rapid proliferation of digital technologies – thus allowing for normative action consistent with human values and ethical defensibility. As information systems researchers, it must be on us to better understand the concept of responsibility as it pertains to the enablement of positive outcomes of ongoing digitalization of our everyday lives while safeguarding the human experience against possible negative consequences of the same. We term this concept 'digital responsibility', which we believe can serve as an organizing construct of research that aims to inform the balancing of ethical and humanistic tensions pertaining to the rapid proliferation of digital technologies.",
                "Notably, focusing on digital responsibility allows us to challenge the often-embraced utopic narrative of digitalization – thus problematizing our vision for this special issue. Digital responsibility is antithetical to 'mindlessness' in designing and implementing digital technologies, which is often associated with the inability 'to cope gracefully with changing, complex situations characteristic of high-risk domains.' The lens of digital responsibility necessitates that we embark upon rigorously analyzing, explaining, predicting, as well as influencing, the potential costs, duties, and obligations of decisions that relate to the development, implementation, and use of digital information and communication technologies. Following such observations, unpacking the phenomenon of 'digital responsibility' should be of utmost concern to IS researchers – and this is the central theme of this special issue.",
                "We are interested in novel, exciting, and thought-provoking contributions that build cumulative knowledge about 'digital responsibility' across all levels (personal, corporate, institutional, and societal) and domains of responsibility (individual, social, ethical, and ecological). So as not to constrain the range of contributions, we suggest understanding digital responsibility broadly as any accountabilities, liabilities, responsibilities, obligations, and duties that relate to the design, development, implementation, use and impact of digital technologies. We deliberately do not limit the call to a specific domain, theoretical lens, or research approach. We are looking for contributions that contain a substantive IS perspective but may also feature interdisciplinary approaches (both theoretical and methodological). We also impose no constraints in terms of theory, method, paradigm, or context. We do not want labels and scripts associated with traditional IS paradigms to constrain how this important and complex phenomenon is investigated.",
                "We welcome the entire spectrum of information systems research and invite innovative, rigorous, relevant, and exciting research on digital responsibility. We welcome empirical, design, as well as conceptual work, and we also welcome carefully crafted commentaries, research perspectives, or opinions. However, in every submission, the chosen research topic should be contemporary and relevant, speaking to current grand challenges of our time. We are not interested in papers that advance methodological contributions even if they might have relevance to the study of digital responsibility. We also do not seek papers that advance our understand of how to build theory about digital responsibility. Likewise, we are not interested in papers whose contributions about digital responsibility build on data that were not originally collected for that purpose. Finally, contributions in which digital responsibility is merely a by-product of some other contribution, however valuable, are also not what we are after."

At the same time, emerging conceptual work has also started to re-examine transition through a historical lens, including how change and adjustment has been treated in historical Information Science scholarship. This adds significant scope for complex conceptual work. The breadth of interest further means that transition has the potential to unify various related fields of study, including information behaviour, practice, and literacy research as well as various disciplinary fields. This Special Issue will provide a platform for the exploration of life transitions from an information behaviour, information practice, or information literacy perspective. The aim is to develop the emerging conceptualisation of what transition means in these fields of study through examining different theoretical models, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. This Special Issue will act as focal point for growing theoretical and empirical interest in the relationship between life transitions and information. **Special Issue Theme** Transitions are a natural state in everyday life. In a broader sense, individuals could be said to be in a constant state of transition, or “transitioning” with every passage in life. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, transition is defined both as a noun and adverb, it is both: “A passing or passage from one condition, action, or (rarely) place, to another; “change” and, “To make or undergo a transition (from one state, system, etc. to or into another); to change over or switch.” From a research perspective, transition is a complex topic that has been variously conceptualised and defined. Transitions can be personal (changes due to changes in life cycle), situational (changes in circumstances in personal or professional life), or environmental (changes in the organisational environment impacting individuals) (Schumacher & Meleis, 1994). These emphases mean that transition has been most comprehensively explored to date within the field of Education and Nursing. Conceptual work in these areas has focused on the process through which people in transition move beyond a disrupted reality to construct a new reality. Information has been found to be a strong trigger in the transition process. Transitions fracture the individual’s information landscapes and require them to learn new “ways of knowing” (Lloyd, 2017), a process that often requires both seeking and avoiding information as a coping mechanism to reduce uncertainty (Savolainen, 2017). This notion of a \"gappy\" reality (Dervin, 1999, p. 370) resonates with sense-making’s premise of discontinuity (Dervin, 2003) as a fundamental aspect of reality that mandates humans to \"take steps to construct sense in constantly changing life situations.\" (Savolainen, 1993, p. 16). \n\n\nAlthough transitions are permeated with information practices of many kinds, information behaviour / practices/ literacy research has engaged only peripherally with ideas of transition and the concept remains underexplored (e.g. Bronstein, 2018; Karim, Widén & Heinström, 2019; Hertzum & Hyldegård, 2019; Hicks, 2019; Huttunen & Kortalainen, 2021; Lloyd, 2017; McKenzie, 2001; Ruthven, 2021; Willson, 2019). Consequently, the aim of this special issue is to extend these initial explorations of transition through an information lens. We invite empirical, conceptual or methodological submissions for this special issue that address one or more of these questions: \n\n- How should transition be conceptualised, studied, evaluated within the field of     information behaviour, information practice or information literacy? \n\n- What is the role of information and information activities, including information     avoidance, in a transition?        o E.g., What role do uncertainty, liminality, agency, reflexivity, time, affect and           place play in shaping transitional information practices? \n\n- What models, theories and concepts from Information Science and beyond are useful     for studying transitions? \n\n- What research methods/methodologies can we use to study transition? e.g.,     interdisciplinary, arts-based, narrative and longitudinal? \n\n- What types of life transitions exist and how can they be conceptualised in information     behaviour, information practice or information literacy? e.g.,        o Physiological, organisational and social transitions        o Health, migration/refugee, education, workplace, intercultural, parenthood,           ageing, religious/spiritual, personal development and gender transitions        o Unexpected or unwanted transitions \n\n- What informational strategies might support transitions? e.g.,     o Community/information intermediaries and gatekeepers     o Information resources     o Educational interventions     o Digital technologies including social media and user-generated content **Paper Development Workshop** Potential authors will have the opportunity to attend an online paper development workshop held on 13th^ September 2023. The workshop will provide an opportunity for those interested in submitting to the special issue to present their in-progress papers and receive feedback and guidance from the guest editors on how to develop their research into papers suitable for the special issue. Those interested in participating in the workshop should submit an extended abstract of up to 1,000 words to Ian Ruthven <ian.ruthven@strath.ac.uk> by August 18th^ 2023. Participation in the workshop is not required for submissions to the special issue, but we encourage those interested in submitting to the special issue to take advantage of this opportunity and receive feedback prior to submitting papers for consideration in the special issue. **Guest Editors** Jenny Bronstein, Bar-Ilan University, Israel Alison Hicks, University College London (UCL), UK Jette Hyldegård, University of Copenhagen, DK Pam McKenzie, The University of Western Ontario, Canada Ian Ruthven, University of Strathclyde, UK Gunilla Widén, Åbo Akademi, Finland \n\n\n**Submission Guidelines** Submit your manuscript through your JASIST author account at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jasist.

        "rawContent": "# Call for Papers \n\n## JASIST Special Issue on “Re-orientating Search Engine Research in \n\n## Information Science” \n\n## Deadline Extended to November 30, 2022 \n\n## Overview \n\nGeneral web search engines are an essential part of today's information infrastructure. They have made it possible to find almost anything on the Internet by typing a few keywords into an empty search box. In fact, search engines have become so integrated into devices and practices that you can get an answer before you even knew how to phrase the question. Search engines shape our lives and at the same time shape the society and culture we live in. We use them at work, in school, in research, in planning our vacations, in finding products, and in politics – just to name a few important areas. The search engine market is dominated by a few companies that have divided the market into regions: Baidu in China, Yandex in Russia and Google in much of the Western world. More competition between search engines is often called for, but is very difficult to achieve. On the other side, we find the content providers doing everything they can by employing various types of search engine optimization (SEO) to achieve the highest rank in the search engine results page when people search for information. In information science, search engines have been studied mainly in the subfield of information retrieval and information behaviour. The study of search engines has thus been a core task of information science since the discipline's beginnings in the 1960s and even before (Saracevic, 2009). With concepts such as relevance or precision and recall, the evaluation of effectiveness has often been the focus of research. While general web search engines play an extremely important role in today's information infrastructure economically, culturally, politically, technically, etc. and have become an integral part of daily life at many levels, information science has only partially embraced the role of general web search engines in society. Research is fragmented into different subfields of information science and these fields do not always communicate well with each other. In this special issue, we call on information science researchers to join us in the investigation of general web search engines, also from outside Information Retrieval. \n\n## Why information science? \n\nInformation science can look back on a long and rich tradition of studying search and search systems. Relevance, one of the most central concepts for even contemporary search engines, has its origin in the field (Saracevic, 1975). Still, there are some blind spots, especially what role different types of relevance play when it comes to search engines (cf. Sundin, Lewandowski & Haider, 2021). These search engines index a plethora of content and have a very low quality threshold when it comes to including documents in their indexes. Therefore, ranking results in a way that benefits users and at the same time provide societal relevance is paramount. From a technical viewpoint, information retrieval research has contributed to search engines by developing indexing methods (e.g., Sparck Jones, 1972) and ranking algorithms, with link-based algorithms being based on central ideas from information science, namely citation analysis (Garfield, 1979). Evaluation campaigns such as TREC (Haarman & Voorhees, 2006) and CLEF (Ferro & Peters, 2019) have developed solid methods and procedures to thoroughly test search engines. On the user side, information science research has contributed to the development and understanding of search engines through developing information-seeking models (e.g., Bates, 1989; Kuhlthau, 2003; Belkin, Oddy & Brooks, 1982) that are used in system development (White, 2016). \n\n\nInformation behaviour re-search has also produced a large body of empirical work on people's behaviour when looking for and using information. Information science, with its rich tradition of studying these topics, provides a good starting point for investigating today's search engines (Haider & Sundin, 2019; Lewandowski, Sünkler & Schultheiß, 2020; Lewandowski et al., 2021). As the field is interdisciplinary, it can also can serve as a hub for integrating research from other fields. \n\n## How is it related to other fields? \n\nSearch engines and their use (search) are studied in different disciplines and from different theoretical perspectives. In addition to information science, information studies, and LIS, the topic has been addressed in disciplines as diverse as science and technology studies (STS), media and communication studies, political science, economics, education, psychology, HCI, or informatics, to name a few. Media-centred and device-centered research exists alongside people-centred studies and research that focuses on society, economics, or politics. While some focus on search engine use in general (e.g., Halavais 2018), others examine specific commercial search engines such as Google (e.g., Hillis et al. 2012), as well as Yandex, Baidu, or various regional services (e.g., Zavadski & Toepfl 2019). Some studies focus on specific groups such as teenagers (e.g., Andersson 2017) or the elderly (Sanchiz et al. 2017), settings, or professions (e.g., Gudmundsdottir and Hartlevik 2020), and others focus on search engine use in relation to other platforms such as social media (e.g., Delmastro & Splendore 2021). More recently, with the emergence of critical algorithm studies and critical AI, the focus has been on the various ways in which Google in particular may be implicated in society's information disorders and problems with misinformation and algorithmic biases that reinforce prejudice and injustice (e.g., Noble, 2018; Puschmann 2019). Another angle has been the central role of Google in capitalism (Bilić 2018; Mager, 2012), while others have examined the role of commercial search engines in reinforcing confirmation biases, partisanship, or hostile media effects (e.g., Tripodi 2018). Although search engines have been studied from many different angles and for a relatively long time, the field is extremely scattered. Not only is there little awareness of each other's work across disciplines, but even across subfields there are few connections. Different disciplinary investigations run in parallel and rarely meet in a productive way. Furthermore, the more commercial search engines fade into the background, the more difficult it becomes to perceive and study them. Moreover, their functioning is largely opaque and beyond the control of society, which in many cases means that the data available for research remains speculative. This may require creative approaches to data collection and methodology, as well as research designs that are open to new influences and experimental tactics. \n\n## Approaches of interest \n\nThis Call for Papers is based on the premise that different approaches need to benefit from each other. We are looking for contributions that broaden the respective disciplinary, methodological, or empirical perspectives to identify and explore commercial search engines and their use and role in society from new angles, or that bring together different approaches in original ways. In particular, we would like to encourage information science/information studies, broadly understood, to reposition themselves and contribute the discipline's expertise to shed light on the ever more powerful role of commercial search engines in almost all areas of society and everyday life, influencing not only how we know and what we know, but increasingly also how knowledge and information are created and communicated, to begin with. The guest-editors welcome papers representing a variety of approaches. Papers can be theoretical, conceptual or empirical or combinations thereof. \n\n\n## Topics of interest include but are not limited to \n\n o Social and cultural aspects of relevance o Epistemic implications of search-engine use o Search engine bias (e.g., in terms of race, gender, class) and marginalization o Fair search o Search engine providers’ responsibility and accountability o Search engines as multi-sided platforms o History of web search and web search engines \n\n- Ethical considerations related to search engines \n\n- Affect and emotional aspects of search engine use \n\n- Information literacy related to search engines \n\n- Search engines and specific groups (children, elderly,...) \n\n- Search engines and studies of ignorance and information avoidance \n\n- Search engines in everyday life and in social practices \n\n- Search engines in educational settings \n\n- Alternative approaches to concepts of indexing in search engines \n\n- Search engines and the role of data voids \n\n- Negotiations of search results (search engine optimization, paid search advertising) \n\n- Search engine comparisons (e.g., comparing results tailored to different locations, comparing     results from different search engines) \n\n- Methods for search engine research \n\n- Data collection for search engine studies \n\n- Approaches to “opening the Black Box of search engine rankings” \n\n- Search and search engines’ position in relation to other platforms \n\n## Guest editors \n\nDirk Lewandowski, Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Hamburg, Germany dirk.lewandowski@haw-hamburg.de Jutta Haider, Swedish School of Library and Information Science, University of Bor ås, Borå s, Sweden jutta.haider@hb.se Olof Sundin, Department of Arts and Cultural Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden olof.sundin@kultur.lu.se \n\n## Submission guidelines \n\n## Submissions should comply with JASIST criteria for a ‘Research Article’ and be at most 7000 \n\n## words in length.

                "General web search engines are an essential part of today's information infrastructure. They have made it possible to find almost anything on the Internet by typing a few keywords into an empty search box. In fact, search engines have become so integrated into devices and practices that you can get an answer before you even knew how to phrase the question. Search engines shape our lives and at the same time shape the society and culture we live in. We use them at work, in school, in research, in planning our vacations, in finding products, and in politics – just to name a few important areas. The search engine market is dominated by a few companies that have divided the market into regions: Baidu in China, Yandex in Russia and Google in much of the Western world. More competition between search engines is often called for, but is very difficult to achieve. On the other side, we find the content providers doing everything they can by employing various types of search engine optimization (SEO) to achieve the highest rank in the search engine results page when people search for information. In information science, search engines have been studied mainly in the subfield of information retrieval and information behaviour. The study of search engines has thus been a core task of information science since the discipline's beginnings in the 1960s and even before (Saracevic, 2009). With concepts such as relevance or precision and recall, the evaluation of effectiveness has often been the focus of research.",
                "While general web search engines play an extremely important role in today's information infrastructure economically, culturally, politically, technically, etc. and have become an integral part of daily life at many levels, information science has only partially embraced the role of general web search engines in society. Research is fragmented into different subfields of information science and these fields do not always communicate well with each other. In this special issue, we call on information science researchers to join us in the investigation of general web search engines, also from outside Information Retrieval.",
                "Information science can look back on a long and rich tradition of studying search and search systems. Relevance, one of the most central concepts for even contemporary search engines, has its origin in the field (Saracevic, 1975). Still, there are some blind spots, especially what role different types of relevance play when it comes to search engines (cf. Sundin, Lewandowski & Haider, 2021). These search engines index a plethora of content and have a very low quality threshold when it comes to including documents in their indexes. Therefore, ranking results in a way that benefits users and at the same time provide societal relevance is paramount. From a technical viewpoint, information retrieval research has contributed to search engines by developing indexing methods (e.g., Sparck Jones, 1972) and ranking algorithms, with link-based algorithms being based on central ideas from information science, namely citation analysis (Garfield, 1979). Evaluation campaigns such as TREC (Haarman & Voorhees, 2006) and CLEF (Ferro & Peters, 2019) have developed solid methods and procedures to thoroughly test search engines. On the user side, information science research has contributed to the development and understanding of search engines through developing information-seeking models (e.g., Bates, 1989; Kuhlthau, 2003; Belkin, Oddy & Brooks, 1982) that are used in system development (White, 2016).",
                "Information behaviour research has also produced a large body of empirical work on people's behaviour when looking for and using information. Information science, with its rich tradition of studying these topics, provides a good starting point for investigating today's search engines (Haider & Sundin, 2019; Lewandowski, Sünkler & Schultheiß, 2020; Lewandowski et al., 2021). As the field is interdisciplinary, it can also serve as a hub for integrating research from other fields.",
                "Search engines and their use (search) are studied in different disciplines and from different theoretical perspectives. In addition to information science, information studies, and LIS, the topic has been addressed in disciplines as diverse as science and technology studies (STS), media and communication studies, political science, economics, education, psychology, HCI, or informatics, to name a few. Media-centred and device-centered research exists alongside people-centred studies and research that focuses on society, economics, or politics. While some focus on search engine use in general (e.g., Halavais 2018), others examine specific commercial search engines such as Google (e.g., Hillis et al. 2012), as well as Yandex, Baidu, or various regional services (e.g., Zavadski & Toepfl 2019). Some studies focus on specific groups such as teenagers (e.g., Andersson 2017) or the elderly (Sanchiz et al. 2017), settings, or professions (e.g., Gudmundsdottir and Hartlevik 2020), and others focus on search engine use in relation to other platforms such as social media (e.g., Delmastro & Splendore 2021). More recently, with the emergence of critical algorithm studies and critical AI, the focus has been on the various ways in which Google in particular may be implicated in society's information disorders and problems with misinformation and algorithmic biases that reinforce prejudice and injustice (e.g., Noble, 2018; Puschmann 2019). Another angle has been the central role of Google in capitalism (Bilić 2018; Mager, 2012), while others have examined the role of commercial search engines in reinforcing confirmation biases, partisanship, or hostile media effects (e.g., Tripodi 2018). Although search engines have been studied from many different angles and for a relatively long time, the field is extremely scattered. Not only is there little awareness of each other's work across disciplines, but even across subfields there are few connections. Different disciplinary investigations run in parallel and rarely meet in a productive way. Furthermore, the more commercial search engines fade into the background, the more difficult it becomes to perceive and study them. Moreover, their functioning is largely opaque and beyond the control of society, which in many cases means that the data available for research remains speculative. This may require creative approaches to data collection and methodology, as well as research designs that are open to new influences and experimental tactics.",
                "This Call for Papers is based on the premise that different approaches need to benefit from each other. We are looking for contributions that broaden the respective disciplinary, methodological, or empirical perspectives to identify and explore commercial search engines and their use and role in society from new angles, or that bring together different approaches in original ways. In particular, we would like to encourage information science/information studies, broadly understood, to reposition themselves and contribute the discipline's expertise to shed light on the ever more powerful role of commercial search engines in almost all areas of society and everyday life, influencing not only how we know and what we know, but increasingly also how knowledge and information are created and communicated, to begin with. The guest-editors welcome papers representing a variety of approaches. Papers can be theoretical, conceptual or empirical or combinations thereof."

        "rawContent": "# Call for Papers \n\n## JASIST Special Issue “Healthier Information Ecosystems” \n\n**Submissions due:** May 1, 2023 **Deadline Extended to May 15 Call for Papers** This special issue, “Healthier Information Ecosystems,” will focus on the interconnected nature of online pathologies, draw attention to the socio-technical aspects of information technology, and animate interdisciplinary approaches to addressing these problems. Similar to Buckminster Fuller’s mission of “World Game,” we want to aid in developing a wide variety of solutions (including but not limited to technical, political, social, and educational) to the wicked problems of our time to make “the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest period of time… without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.” We invite contributions that address the socio-cultural embeddedness of the problems plaguing information ecosystems and provide new ways of thinking about and strategies to achieve a healthier global information environment. We are actively seeking a broad approach to issues of healthier information ecosystems, including both theoretical and applied, qualitative and quantitative, as well as inside and outside the discipline of information science and technology. We are interested in transdisciplinary contributions that move beyond narrow, cross-sectional treatments of online phenomena to highlight the socio-technical dynamics of online spaces framed in cultural-historical contexts. As Rong Tang (Tang et al., 2021) and colleagues mentioned in their 2021 _JASIST_ piece, information science is experiencing a paradigm shift and the need to better understand the socio-technical side of information technology is central to this change. **Motivation** There is no shortage of research examining the pathological aspects of our modern information ecosystems, covering a broad spectrum of socio-technical phenomena including (but not limited to) misinformation, toxicity, polarization, and extremism. Together, these phenomena might be considered to be a sign of an “unhealthy” information ecosystem. However, our collective understanding of the problem remains fragmented and incomplete, impeding our ability to identify and implement successful solutions. For this special issue, we seek papers that take an interdisciplinary approach to expanding our understanding of information ecosystems by answering such vital questions as: What does it mean to live in an unhealthy information ecosystem, is it possible to envision a healthier one, and how do we get from here to there? While many of the problems in online settings have been examined in isolation, they are often intimately connected—each problem can be both cause and consequence of the others. For instance, toxic online content is made even more virulent by bogus claims and misinformation that is amplified by social media’s and search engines’ network infrastructure (e.g., Benkler et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021; Donovan, 2020; Freelon & Lokot, 2020; Freelon & Wells, 2020; Haider & Sundin, 2019, 2022; Nisbet et al., 2021; Ognyanova et al., 2020; Tripodi, 2021; Uyheng \n\n\n& Carley, 2020). Misinformation (and disinformation) can inflame conspiracy theories that demonize outgroups and reinforce social identity dynamics, driving further polarization (Ribeiro et al., 2017; Vicario et al., 2019) and paving the way for toxic online cultures ( Judson, et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021; Pascual-Ferrá et al., 2021; Thomas et al., 2021). We adopt an ecosystems framing to highlight such interconnectedness. The problems that now occupy many researchers’ work emerge from complex, technologically mediated networks and interconnected systems of people, institutions, and cultures that create, spread, organize, and amplify information. This complex system is a rich avenue for inquiry by the research community, but focusing on isolated aspects while neglecting their interrelationships will miss systemic opportunities to intervene. Moreover, problems like misinformation, toxicity, and polarization are influenced by contextual factors including social norms, economics, power structures, and worldviews. If we fail to examine information science and technology against this backdrop, stakeholders inside and outside of the academy are unlikely to identify realistic strategies for improving information ecosystems. **Themes to Consider** We are open to a wide variety of methodologies, including empirical, theoretical, and applied. We are also open to contributions that propose new approaches to exploring these issues and/or solutions from an interconnected information ecosystem perspective, but such papers should clearly explain how the proposed approaches will contribute to substantive solutions. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: **_Definitions of healthy ecosystems_** ● Ethical models for evaluating the health of online information ecosystems ● Multilevel metrics for evaluating the health of online information ecosystems **_Strategies for creating healthy ecosystems_** ● Design and collective human dynamics ● Disrupting systems of misand dis-information in politics and democracy, including national, state, and local politics. ● Educational interventions **_Connecting information to other disciplines_** ● Information as a social, political, economic, and cultural phenomenon ● Interdisciplinary perspectives and approaches to information and media ● The role of information ecosystems in conspiracy theories ● Interactions between online and offline decision making and behavior ● Information architecture, interface design and psychological biases of information consumers ● Engaging with systems of power; who is advantaged and who is disadvantaged from current or future systems **_New methods of theory, research, and application of information ecosystems_** \n\n\n● Complex dynamics of information, social interaction and cognition ● Social dynamics and digital media ecosystems ● How policy, economic, and market forces shape algorithm design and development ● Big data, open science, and their socio-cultural impacts ● Hijacking of user-generated content and / or AI-generated content ● Misand dis-information transference during the COVID 19 pandemic Papers should speak to the information science community, but do so in an interdisciplinary manner that centers on the interplay of information, technology, and society. We are eager to receive contributions from disciplines that might lend new perspectives, including (but not limited to) statistical physics, complex systems, biology, environmental science, economics, management science, organization science, communication, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy. All contributions should clarify how they can be used to help our information ecosystems work for the betterment of society at large, developing an inclusive and thus “healthy” ecosystem. **Introduction to Guest Editors** We are a team of scholars from information science, computer science, communication, and sociology looking for paper contributions that tackle these important questions.

                "This special issue, “Healthier Information Ecosystems,” will focus on the interconnected nature of online pathologies, draw attention to the socio-technical aspects of information technology, and animate interdisciplinary approaches to addressing these problems. Similar to Buckminster Fuller’s mission of 'World Game,' we want to aid in developing a wide variety of solutions (including but not limited to technical, political, social, and educational) to the wicked problems of our time to make 'the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest period of time… without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.' We invite contributions that address the socio-cultural embeddedness of the problems plaguing information ecosystems and provide new ways of thinking about and strategies to achieve a healthier global information environment.",
                "We are actively seeking a broad approach to issues of healthier information ecosystems, including both theoretical and applied, qualitative and quantitative, as well as inside and outside the discipline of information science and technology. We are interested in transdisciplinary contributions that move beyond narrow, cross-sectional treatments of online phenomena to highlight the socio-technical dynamics of online spaces framed in cultural-historical contexts.",
                "As Rong Tang (Tang et al., 2021) and colleagues mentioned in their 2021 JASIST piece, information science is experiencing a paradigm shift and the need to better understand the socio-technical side of information technology is central to this change.",
                "There is no shortage of research examining the pathological aspects of our modern information ecosystems, covering a broad spectrum of socio-technical phenomena including (but not limited to) misinformation, toxicity, polarization, and extremism. Together, these phenomena might be considered to be a sign of an 'unhealthy' information ecosystem. However, our collective understanding of the problem remains fragmented and incomplete, impeding our ability to identify and implement successful solutions.",
                "For this special issue, we seek papers that take an interdisciplinary approach to expanding our understanding of information ecosystems by answering such vital questions as: What does it mean to live in an unhealthy information ecosystem, is it possible to envision a healthier one, and how do we get from here to there? While many of the problems in online settings have been examined in isolation, they are often intimately connected—each problem can be both cause and consequence of the others. For instance, toxic online content is made even more virulent by bogus claims and misinformation that is amplified by social media’s and search engines’ network infrastructure.",
                "Misinformation (and disinformation) can inflame conspiracy theories that demonize outgroups and reinforce social identity dynamics, driving further polarization and paving the way for toxic online cultures. We adopt an ecosystems framing to highlight such interconnectedness. The problems that now occupy many researchers’ work emerge from complex, technologically mediated networks and interconnected systems of people, institutions, and cultures that create, spread, organize, and amplify information.",
                "This complex system is a rich avenue for inquiry by the research community, but focusing on isolated aspects while neglecting their interrelationships will miss systemic opportunities to intervene. Moreover, problems like misinformation, toxicity, and polarization are influenced by contextual factors including social norms, economics, power structures, and worldviews. If we fail to examine information science and technology against this backdrop, stakeholders inside and outside of the academy are unlikely to identify realistic strategies for improving information ecosystems."

        "rawContent": " Call for Papers for a Special Issue of the Journal of Information Technology on: \n\n# “Regulation in the Age of Digitalization” \n\n**Special Issue Editors: Daniel Gozman** , University of Sydney – Australia (daniel.gozman@sydney.edu.au, corresponding) **Tom Butler** , University College Cork – Ireland **Kalle Lyytinen** , Case Western Reserve University – USA The rise of information technology (IT) in organizations has been an inherent part of an agenda to increase and shape forms of social control. Despite the inherent link between uses of IT and social control, the topic of regulation has not received significant attention in the information system field – neither theoretically nor empirically. This special seeks to address this gap. The issue explores the growing and significant interplay between IT and regulation in the age of digitalization, where new challenges with social control with IT are emerging. In this special issue, we are interested in two broad domains of research related to regulation and IT: regulation _through_ IT and regulation _of_ IT. The first domain – **regulation through IT** – concerns new forms and arenas of regulation enacted through innovative IT solutions (often called “RegTech”). These technologies which are increasingly implicated in regulatory practices include new forms of real-time big data analytics, machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, use of blockchains and distributed ledgers, Internet of Things solutions or natural language processing techniques. These technologies change the ways organizations and industrial sectors respond to and comply with a growing number of regulatory obligations and needs (Butler and O’Brien, 2019; Gozman et al 2018). These technologies are also driving changes in the ways in which regulators seek to supervise and monitor firms and the ways in which firms comply with laws and regulations. Greater market and organisational transparency and enhanced supervision are now advocated as critical responses to organizational misconduct and associated risks (Currie, Gozman and Seddon 2018; Roberts, 2009). This has resulted in an increasing call for bureaucratization and (over-)regulation (Graeber, 2013). Call for greater monitoring, supervision and sanctioning have been driven by concerns regarding the environment, health and safety risks, corporate fiscal and fiduciary scandals (e.g., Enron), financial failures leading to financial crisis in 2007-2008, or growing violations of data privacy (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation) increased the “volume, velocity and variety” of laws and regulations that organizations must comply with and the range of novel IT based solutions they need to comply to such demands (Gozman and Currie, 2014; Vaujany, Fomin, Haefliger, and Lyytinen, 2018; Butler & O’Brien, 2019). Regulators have also shown a growing appetite to measure performance, to quantify financial, regulatory and operational risk and to \n\n\nimprove compliance reporting through new technologies that assign accountability, enforce security and behavioural control, automate monitor and enhance record keeping (Williams 2012; Baskerville et al. 2018). The second domain – **regulation of IT** – is the wide range deployment and associated regulatory effects of new IT (esp. concerns of security, privacy and/or safety). There is a notable gap in the field’s knowledge regarding new demands and ways of regulating IT (e.g., social media) given its scale, complexity and pervasive use. Concerns regarding the pervasive effects of platform businesses (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon etc.) on privacy, competition and information veracity have invited calls to control and scrutinize technology vendors (e.g., Zuboff 2015, 2019). Similar issues are likely to emerge in autonomous cars, user-based insurance, health policies and so on. There are consequently increased demands to regulate various IT solutions and to increase regulatory powers of governments related to IT uses, including through introducing entirely new regulatory bodies. If platform providers and vendors, or organizations offering extensive algorithmic solutions as parts of their related services (e.g., Uber), are subjected to new regulatory structures, then important questions arise regarding what degrees of transparency and reporting are appropriate and how related forms of supervision and sanctioning would function that need to regulate actual systems and their functioning and those who are implicated in their design. We invite empirical and theoretical research that contribute to our understanding and application how regulation is enacted through IT or how uses of IT can be regulated. We encourage submissions that use diverse epistemological and methodological approaches to focus on emerging and new regulatory solutions and practices. Submissions may engage in cross-disciplinary inquiries and should offer novel knowledge and fresh methodological, theoretical and empirical insights how regulation and IT evolve and are related. The papers will be evaluated for their interestingness, novelty and credibility of the contribution. If in doubt, interested authors should consult the special issue guest editors whether their papers fall within the scope of the special issue. To this end, authors are encouraged to submit an extended abstract to the editors for initial feedback. Topics of the special include but are not limited to: **Domain 1: Regulatory technologies for supervising and complying (“regulation through IT”)** ▪ Theoretical analyses and frames for understanding regulatory technologies and how they shape social control and its various forms. ▪ New roles and demands for IT based audits and related challenges. ▪ The changing role of IT for regulatory intelligence and change management. ▪ Managerial implications of regulatory technologies in vertical industries such as financial services, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, healthcare, aviation etc. ▪ The nature, scope and effects of digitisation of governance, risk and compliance practices and related mechanisms. ▪ Innovation and entrepreneurship in regulatory technologies (e.g., sandboxes, incubators, accelerators). \n\n\n▪ C-suite roles and responses with regard to regulatory technologies and the changing nature and role of regulatory function in organizations. ▪ Technologies for identifying, monitoring and mitigating operational and financial risks. ▪ Managing organizational failures using RegTech. ▪ Using digital technologies to address anti-money laundering (AML), terrorist financing and fraud. ▪ The use of regulatory technology in developing countries. **Domain 2: Regulating new technologies and platforms (“regulation of IT”)** ▪ Regulation of social media technologies and platforms. ▪ Regulation of IT solutions and related solutions during design, implementation and use. ▪ Regulation of AI. ▪ How to bridge the gap between ethics and policy (e.g., for AI)? Where is the overlap and divergence? ▪ Strategic implications of regulating technologies for nations, industries and firms. ▪ Solutions for data privacy, protection, governance and “fake news”. ▪ Cybersecurity obligations and mitigating related risks at the organizational level including network security and defence systems implementation and management. **Submission Timetable** Manuscripts will go through no more than two rounds of review. Submitted papers may be invited to be presented at workshop connected to this special issue. ▪ First round submission: 31 st^ January 2021 ▪ Round 1 decision to authors: 1 st^ March 2021 ▪ Second round submission: 1 st^ July 2021 ▪ Second round decision to authors: 1 st^ September 2021 ▪ Third and Final Round submissions: 1 st^ November 2021 ▪ Final decision to authors: December 2021 **Editorial Review Board** Barney Tan University of Sydney – Australia Chris Parker American University – USA David Tilson University of Rochester – USA Eric Lim University New South Wales– Australia Francois de Vaujany Université Paris-Dauphine – France \n\n\nFrantz Rowe Université de Nantes– France Heiko Gewald Neu-Ulm University of Applied Science – Germany Jonas Hedman Copenhagen Business School – Denmark M.

These include robotic process automation (Coombs et al. 2020; Lacity and Willcocks 2016), big data (Wiener et al. 2020), machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2016 ), blockchain (Du et al. 2019) and other “emerging technologies”. Consulting and market research companies have consistently predicted that the current wave of technologies will transform both front and back office operations, requiring firms to rethink their business models and strategies^1. While evidence suggests that firms will continue to invest in emerging technologies^2 , there has so far been little evidence about the involvement of service providers and advisory in the selection, design and adoption of such emerging technologies. IS sourcing research has conventionally accounted for three main areas of interest: sourcing decision, contractual structures and relationship management (Kotlarsky et al. 2020 ). Emerging technologies challenge these traditional conventions in the IS sourcing literature^3. Particular challenges include but are not limited to: § There is greater dependency on data in emerging technologies, which triggers clients to source data science services; § The actual implementation of emerging technology often happens through platforms that involve multiple players and services; § The asset transfer model has become less relevant and yet client firms are still expected to reduce their headcount; § There is greater emphasis on the redesign of the value chain as services have become digitized and decisions are now driven by smart algorithms; § At the same time, emerging technologies are viewed as a black box, posing a skills and expertise challenge to client firms to ensure acquiring and retaining knowledge of the \n\n(^1) https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-94/accenture-techvision2019 tech-trends-report.pdf.

(^3) Traditional conventions of IS sourcing are covered in literature reviews, such as Dibbern et al. (2004), Karimi-Alaghehband et al. (2011), Lacity et al. (2016) and Kotlarsky et al.

Further, the IS sourcing literature which has traditionally relied on three main reference theories, namely, transaction cost economics, resource dependency and social exchange (e.g., Karimi-Alaghehband et al. 2011; Chang et al, 2017; Kotlarsky et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2019 ). Emerging technologies emphasize the need of expanding this theoretical base and accommodating new paradigms of capturing and analysing data in IS sourcing research. Taking into account the above observations, the IS sourcing literature thus begs for the reexamination of client-supplier-advisory relationships by challenging core concepts of sourcing decision, contractual structure and relationship management as offering new theoretical landscapes that accommodate the sourcing phenomenon in a digital age. This special issue seeks to facilitate an empirical and theoretical re-examination of “IS sourcing” in the light of the current wave of emerging technologies. Areas of interest to the special issue include but not limited to: § Governance and control structures between client-supplier-advisory in emerging technology settings; § Sourcing decision making in emerging technology settings; § Ecosystem and platforms in emerging technology sourcing settings; § Contract management in emerging technology sourcing settings; § Full data lifecycle in emerging technologies and its implications for sourcing management; § Skills and capability development and retention in emerging technology sourcing settings; § Implications for innovations within the client-supplier-advisory eco-system; § Ethical and societal implications deriving from such sourcing settings; § Impact of emerging technologies on client’s, supplier’s and advisory’s strategies, business models and capabilities (e.g., has offshoring slowed down/back sourcing accelerated? And what was the impact on captive centers’ services). § Implications of “crowdsourcing”, big data, analytics as well as machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence for the contemporary IS outsourcing. We invite research papers that investigate issues relating to emerging technologies and IS sourcing. In particular, we take interest in issues concerning robotic process automation, big data, machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence and blockchain. Other technologies are less of interest for this special issue (contact the special issue editors if in doubt). **Submission Timetable** \n\n- First round submission deadline: 15th^ April 2021 \n\n- First round decision to authors: 25 th^ July 2021 \n\n- Second round submission deadline: 25th^ October 2021 \n\n\n- Second round decision to authors: 28 th^ January 2022 \n\n- Third and final round submissions deadline: 15th^ April 2022 \n\n- Final decision to authors: 15 th^ June 2022 JIT submission guidelines: https://journals.sagepub.com/author-instructions/JIN JIT submission site: https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jin.

K. Cheung** , Hong Kong Baptist University – Hong Kong **Suprateek (“Supra”) Sarker** , University of Virginia – USA **Jason B. Thatcher** , Temple University – USA Disruptive digital innovations do not come without pain – the disorder that they introduce can create negative externalities and unintended consequences for people, communities, industries and economies. In the worst case, there is disruption with little innovation. This can lead to job losses for individuals, loss of human dignity, negative health impacts, lost revenue for communities, obsolescence of industries and loss of the traditional values that underpin modern societies. Sarker et al. (2019) note that “humanistic concerns arising from the curtailing of human freedom and development, and from racism, sexism and commodification of the human body are overlooked for the apparent benefits that systems, including widely used search engines and medical databases, promise to deliver (Noble 2018; Wachter-Boettcher 2017). Indeed, there is a rising need for a thorough ethical interrogation of algorithms (O’Neil 2016) that underlie systems mediating many critical human activities, so as not to marginalize certain stakeholders, especially those ‘who are already in the margin’ (Noble 2018, p. 171).” In this special issue, we take this critical, yet constructive view of technological and social changes associated with “digital transformation” (Zuboff 2015, Wood et al. 2019, Larsson and Teigland 2020). We are interested in contrarian papers that reject the taken-for-granted assumptions of positive impacts of technology, as in cases of digital platforms, telework enabled by mobility, growth of the gig economy, fintech/blockchain, and so on, and investigate relatively unexamined platform externalities as a means to identify ways to resolve paradoxes, discontinuities and challenges posed by technology and the unintended consequences of technology applications. We also seek papers that shed light on the problems of information technology (IT)enabled phenomena such as the implications of winner-takes-all platform economics; highlight the social, \n\n\nenvironmental and economic implications of blockchain and similar innovative digital technologies; or propose solutions that mitigate negative societal impacts of innovation (e.g., through leveraging the power social networks to disseminate information and strengthen democratic discourse). We encourage the submission of manuscripts taking either of two stances: 1) Submissions considering a **critical or dystopian view** of the social, technological and moral implications of digitization and digital transformation. Here, “the dark side” – ethical Issues, unintended digitalization and other problematic aspects – of digitalization and platformization are front and centre the argument. An example may be Zuboff’s (2015, 2019 ) recent work on surveillance capitalism and her analyses of large-scale digitization “gone wrong”. 2) Submissions seeking to **balance or reconcile “the dark side” and “the bright side”** of digitalization and platformization. Here, analyses, exemplars and theoretical frameworks considered ethical issues and negative consequences explicitly, in addition to intended benefits of digitalization too often exclusively focused on. An example may be social media research: initial writings trumpeted the benefits of social media for building relationships, with later work highlighting problematic behaviours such as cyberbullying or doxxing. In this special issue, we are open to all forms of inquiry, including surveys, experiments, case studies, design science projects and conceptual work that probe “the dark side”, ethical issues and unintended consequences of digitization, platformization and the rapid diffusion of digital infrastructures and digital work models based thereon. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: ▪ Digital Taylorism and the race to the bottom for workers ▪ Destruction of jobs by “botization” ▪ Risks for society from fast-spreading false information ▪ Systemic risks and vulnerability of digital platforms ▪ Management incompetence in digital transformation ▪ Risks of IoT and blockchain ▪ Dark side and ethics of sharing economy and gig economy ▪ Digital privacy and surveillance capitalism ▪ Bias in algorithms and artificial intelligence ▪ Digital inequity and digital divide between “the North” and “the South” ▪ Fake news, misinformation, and disinformation in social media \n\n\n▪ Fake and biased online reviews and co-creation on digital platforms ▪ The emergence of deep web/darknet marketplaces ▪ Subjective well-being (e.g., FOMO and social media fatigue) ▪ Cyberharassment, cyberbullying and cyberstalking **Submission Timetable** Manuscripts will go through no more than two rounds of review. ▪ Authors are invited to submit abstracts of papers aimed at the special issue directly to the special issue editors (via email) for early feedback. ▪ First round submission: 1 st^ June 2021 ▪ First round decision to authors: 1 st^ Oct 2021 ▪ Special issue workshop at ICIS 2021 (TBA) ▪ Second round submission: 1 st^ Feb 2022 ▪ Second round decision to authors: 1 st^ Apr 2022 (reject or accept w minor revision) **Editorial Review Board** Margunn Aanestad, Agder University, Norway Alexander Benlian, TU Darmstadt, Germany Michelle Carter, Washington State University, USA Tommy Chan, Northumbria University, UK Mike Dinger, University of South Carolina-Upstate, USA Taha Havakor, Temple University USA J.

        "rawContent": " Call for Papers for a Special Issue of the Journal of Information Technology on: \n\n# “Products of Theorizing: \n\n# Towards Native Theories of Emerging IT” \n\n**Special Issue Editors: Nik Hassan** , University of Minnesota Duluth – USA (nhassan@d.umn.edu, corresponding) **Suzanne Rivard** , HEC Montreal – Canada **Ulrike Schultze** , Southern Methodist University – USA **Leslie Willcocks** , London School of Economics and Political Science – UK Theorizing is one of the defining aspects of academic research. Articulating insights generated from situated empirical observations into relatively stable abstractions (e.g., concepts, propositions, models) that elucidate, explain or predict events occurring at another time and place is the hallmark of knowledge generation (King 2021). Of late, much attention has been paid to theory development in the Information Systems (IS) field. For example, the MIS Quarterly (MISQ) special issue on “Next-Generation Information Systems Theorizing” reflects a sense of urgency felt within the IS field to make sense of an increasingly unruly and complex reality given the increasing pace of technological innovation (Burton-Jones et al. 2021). In similar vein, two 2021 Journal of Information Technology (JIT) debates sections focused on “IS Research and Science” (Siponen and Klaavuniemi 2020, and commentaries) and “Theorising as Craft” (Rivard 2 021, and commentaries) and a recent Journal of the Association for Information System’s (JAIS) special issue focused on “Envisioning Digital Transformation–Advancing Theoretical Diversity”. New and native IS theories ensure that the IS field remains vibrant, diverse, academically and socially relevant and influential (Hassan 2011; Hassan and Willcocks 2021; Lowry et al. 2020; Markus and Saunders 2007). Researchers, however, often set the bar too high for theory delivered within individual research contributions by viewing theory as a comprehensive and detailed explanation of a phenomenon (Rivard 2021), an object that Weick (1995) refers to as a “theory that sweeps away all others” (p. 386). This mindset may lead IS researchers to adopt theories from other fields as a foundation rather than creatively developing new and native theories from empirical observations (Grover and Lyytinen 2015). \n\n\nTo maintain the long-term growth and vitality of the IS field, a definition of theory that encourages cumulative and novel theorizing over time is needed (Hassan and Willcocks 2021; King 2021). One way of achieving this is by advancing a “products of theorising” perspective (Weick 1995). The theorising perspective celebrates both the final outcomes and the “interim struggles” that characterize theory generation (Weick 1995). It holds the promise that interim conceptual artefacts of theorizing such as metaphors, frameworks and concepts (Lowry et al. 2020) are valuable to the discipline as they can be leveraged and exploited further in subsequent research. In this way, a discipline might inch its way towards native theories over time. The goal of this special issue is to solicit and showcase exemplars from the “products of theorizing” approach. We are looking for articles that go beyond verification dimensions of the natural-science approach to IS research (Schlagwein 2021) and push the envelope of theorizing towards native products of theorizing (Hassan et al. (forthcoming): theory frame devices (i.e., questions, paradigms, laws and frameworks), theory generators (i.e., myths, analogies, metaphors and models) and theory components (i.e., concepts, constructs, statements and hypotheses). The time is ripe to embark upon the development of native theories in the IS field, as IT has leaped into the consciousness of the public in unprecedented ways. Big data and AI applications are part of consumers’ and workers’ everyday lives, either enhancing them or increasing their visibility (Aral 2020; Benbya et al. 2021; Zuboff 2019); firms increasingly deploy robotic process automation and cognitive automation, aiming to achieve benefits for themselves, their employees and their customers (Lacity and Willcocks 2021); and governments rely on new forms of data collection about citizens (e.g., blood samples, vaccination data, fingerprints, iris-recognition systems) in support of the services they provide (Kolas et al. 2021). To take advantage of the theorizing opportunities that these emergent information technology (IT) phenomena provide, the goal of this special issue is to encourage research that generates products of theorizing derived from and related to IT phenomena. We are seeking contributions that develop products of theorizing, that is, interim constructions, that are useful as precursors to strong native IS theory. To increase the likelihood of a theorizing product’s value, we are particularly interested in research that tackles phenomena that are core to the IS discipline. Given the multifaceted nature of the IS discipline, we do not expect agreement on what constitutes a core IS phenomenon. We therefore encourage authors to make the case that the products of theorizing they develop are valuable for articulating native theories that are defining of the field of IS or are substantially valuable for their specific area. Examples of work we are interested include but are not limited to: § Use of theory generators (e.g., analogies, myths, models and metaphors) for understanding and guiding research of emergent phenomena such as surveillance capitalism, fake news, social media, or the performativity of big data and AI. § Constructing or formulating novel frameworks derived from or relevant to emerging technologies. \n\n\n§ Adopting a genealogical lens to uncover the products of theorizing that have been instrumental in the theories that have become popular in the IS discipline (e.g., socio-technical, sociomateriality, imbrication). § Reviewing and analysing the foundations of core concepts of the IS field such as that of “information,” “system” and “technology”. § Re-theorizing areas or subfields within IS (e.g., design science, data analytics, big data, AI) where native products of theorizing are sparse. § Problematizing the IS field (i.e., going beyond gap-spotting and borrowing theory from reference disciplines) to identify questions and challenges that the field of IS is uniquely qualified to address. § Inventing native original concepts in the IS field that will serve as foundations for the scientific IS research method and declare to the world, the field’s core concerns. § Exploring the role of scientific laws in IS research as a product of theorizing with relevance to emerging phenomena. § Unpacking products of theorizing (e.g., questions, models and frameworks) that uncover deep-seated assumptions about contemporary IS phenomena (e.g., symbols of value, solidarity, social structure, conflict and contradictions within a technology-driven society) that are especially relevant to emerging technologies. § Distinguishing between non-observable constructs from more observable concepts that are rarely discussed in IS research but form the mainstay of scientific studies. § Aggregating the statements, claims and propositions that have been made by a stream of IS literature and that are deemed most impactful on and relevant for contemporary users, organizations and society, to set the stage for the further progress towards native IS theory. \n\n## Submission Guide \n\nJournal of Information Technology special issue papers will go through no more than two full rounds of peer review.

        "rawContent": " Call for Papers for a Special Issue of the Journal of Information Technology on: \n\n# “Digital Transformation as \n\n# Geo-Political, Organizational and Technological Nexus” \n\n**Special Issue Editors: Wendy L. Currie** , Audencia Business School – France (wcurrie@audencia.com, corresponding) **Carol Hsu** , The University of Sydney – Australia **Ben Van Vliet** , Illinois Institute of Technology – USA **Vishanth Weerakkody** , University of Bradford – UK This special issue focuses on the currently ongoing – and recently COVID19 accelerated – digital transformation(s) of economy and society. That is, how industry sectors and societal domains are reshaped by the geo-political, organizational and technological nexus that is \"digital transformation\". The literature on digital transformation is interdisciplinary, spanning fields such as information systems (Vial, 2019), management (Hanelt et al., 2021) and other business disciplines (Verhoef et al., 2021). However, this work's broad range and somewhat incoherent framings show a lack of consensus of \"digital transformation\" as both a theoretical concept and an empirical field (Warner and Wager, 2019). Thus far, most digital transformation studies have focused on the organization as the unit of analysis. Why a single definition of digital transformation may be elusive, the digital transformation seems most often used to as a just a shorthand for IT-enabled organizational transformation (Besson and Rowe, 2012; Wessel et al, 2020), an organization-centric approach. Digital transformation processes increasingly take place at wider scales, beyond individual organizations and their business processes. Digital transformation(s) affect financial markets (Currie et al., 2018), healthcare (Pouloudi et al., 2016) or government (Weerakkody et al., 2016). Digital transformation(s) hence often have disruptive effects in relation to industry structures, corporate strategy, consumer experiences, policies and overall economic and societal trajectories (Legner et al., 2017; Zuboff, 2015; Vial, 2019). In this special issue, we invite especially that a) study digital transformation as a process (preferred over simplistic “cause-and-effect” hypotheses), and b) understand digital transformation in a broad sense, that is, in relation to industries, governments, economies and societies (preferred over organization-centric approaches). **a) We are interested in work that understands digital transformation as a process.** Studies of interest may use process theories, process analyses and/or process data to provide explanations (Langley, 1999). Process studies offer a means of conceptualizing events and identifying patterns (Gehman et al., 2018). These aspects have often been neglected in IS studies in favour of simplistic variance models (Karpovsky and Galliers 2015). Approaching digital transformation fundamentally as a process promises to produce theoretical accounts with nuanced explanations of change (Weick and Quinn, 1999). Variance models (and other types of models) are also welcomed to the special issue. Still, they will be expected to pay attention to digital transformation as a process and not to neglect the relevant processual patterns or temporal order. \n\n\n**b) We are interested in work that studies digital transformation in a broad sense.** Such work may see digital transformation as a nexus of technological, organizational, industrial, economic, governmental, societal and geo-political changes. This nexus invites theoretical and empirical studies which extend organization-centric views to understanding wider processes in which digital IT plays a key role. Emerging IT (artificial intelligence and machine learning, robotics and automation, blockchains and cryptocurrencies, meta-verses, remote working technologies, etc.) may generate specific opportunities for such research. Digital transformations come with significant challenges for businesses and societies, governments, and regulators across jurisdictions. Organization-centric approaches are welcomed to the special issue but must pay attention to wider developments and contexts and argue why the organization is the best locus of study. In preparing papers for this special issue, authors are expected to engage with the concept of digital transformation as a process and provide critical theoretical and/or empirical analysis extending beyond IT-driven change of isolated business processes. Areas of interest to the special issue include but are not limited to: § Multilevel/different units of analysis conceptualizations of digital transformation. § Digital transformation of industry sectors (e.g., health, finance, retail). § Digital transformation driven by ecosystems and platforms. § Regulation and governance of digital transformation. § Process studies on digital transformation identifying episodic and/or continuous changes. § Revealing unintended consequences of digital transformation or the corresponding policies, strategies, and operations. § Multi-disciplinary studies on digital transformation, esp. if leading to novel theoretical perspectives. § Extreme or revealing digital transformation cases or scenarios. **Submission Guide:** Journal of Information Technology special issue papers will go through no more than two full rounds of peer review.

        "rawContent": " Call for Papers for a Special Issue of the Journal of Information Technology on: \n\n# “Next-Generation Information Systems Research Methods” \n\n**Special Issue Editors: Ivo Blohm** , University of St. Gallen – Switzerland (ivo.blohm@unisg.ch, corresponding) **Susanna Ho,** Australian National University – Australia **Shaila Miranda** , University of Oklahoma – USA **Jan Marco Leimeister** , University of St. Gallen – Switzerland This special issue is interested in “next-generation” research methods for studying information technology (IT) phenomena – particularly in the information system (IS) research field. So far, IS researchers have applied a range of quantitative, qualitative and engaged methods to study ITrelated phenomena. Quantitative IS research has often followed a positivist approach of hypothesis testing, with sometimes “first-generation” regression models distinguished from “secondgeneration” structural equation models (Gerow et al. 2011). Data used in such methods stems from surveys, experiments, panel studies, etc. The primary objective of this research stream typically is theory testing. Qualitative IS research has ranged from positivist to interpretivist, seeking rich situated insights via case studies, grounded theory or ethnographies. One objective of this research stream is theory construction. Critical and emancipatory IS research adds a strong value orientation and theoretical basis to qualitative research. Another type of IS research seeks to generate new knowledge with “engaged” methods like design science or action research. The objective of this stream that differentiates it from the first two is the focus on solving important individual, organizational or societal challenges; or extending the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts (Baskerville and Wood-Harper 1996; Hevner et al. 2004). In recent years, the scope of and possibilities for IS research have tremendously widened. Digital IT have become mainstream at the individual, organizational and societal levels (Burton-Jones et al. 2021). Digital IT is key to innovation in various domains from medicine to education, from psychology to the arts. Hence, these domains have become of interest and relevance to IS researchers, yet also overlap with other fields and are hence interdisciplinary in nature. These innovations are increasing the volume and variety of trace data available to researchers but necessitate a shift in our research practices (Johnson et al. 2019). Further, big data, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide a plethora of powerful approaches for collecting and analysing data at a scale not possible before such that we might need to adapt our research methods and tools to make this data actionable and to generate novel knowledge. These ML technologies are being applied not only to theory testing but also to theory construction \n\n- in conjunction with or independent of qualitative methods (Miranda et al. 2022). This special issue focuses on the next generation of research methods to study IT – new methods relevant to the IS research field that account for a) the interdisciplinary nature and wider scope of IT phenomena, and/or b) the novel capacities afforded by new technologies/techniques (e.g., ML/AI). The way that novel technologies and techniques afford new possibilities is quite apparent in quantitative IS research. In contrast to “first-generation” regression-based approaches and \n\n\n“second-generation” structural equation modelling, a new generation of research methods including the predictive analytics (Shmueli and Koppius 2011), data mining (Smith 2020), ML (Shrestha et al. 2020) or explainable AI (Gunning et al. 2019) come with substantial new opportunities and challenges. For instance, these methods potentially allow for more fine-grained measurements and analyses to extend our knowledge of existing phenomena and may help us study novel phenomena including those that were, methodologically speaking, “out of reach” (George et al. 2016). These technological advancements enable us to progress our research toolkit and inform new ways of generating knowledge and theorizing (Burton-Jones et al. 2021; Shrestha et al. 2020). Increased recognition of abduction as a counterpart to deductive and inductive reasoning (Behfar and Okhuysen 2018; Sætre and Van de Ven 2021) pits concerns about practices such as HARKing (Kerr 1998) – hypothesizing after the results are known (aka p-hacking) – believed to lead to logically and scientifically flawed hypotheses, against concerns about stifling the advancement of knowledge (Pratt et al. 2019). ML/AI techniques are now so powerful that they can test millions of models on large data sets to find the “best-matching” model (of all possible) for what needs to be explained. This is a fundamental gear change in what can be done with quantitative data sets, the promise and validity of which are hotly debated (Kitchin 2014; Smith 2020). In terms of changes to the nature of the IS domains, qualitative-interpretative researchers seek to find new methods suitable for the wider, interdisciplinary scope of IS research. This is done via finding or developing analytical new grounds and looking at digital IT differently (e.g. via sociomaterial or affordances perspectives), seeking additional foundations in other fields (e.g., Zuboff’s (2015) political economy informed analysis of surveillance capitalism and “Big Tech”) or via the modification of methods to suit digital environments (e.g., virtual ethnographies or computational grounded theory). Other forms of qualitative research such as meta-synthesis, qualitative comparative analysis and discourse analysis also seem promising and relevant but are seldomly used in IS research. Digital IT (e.g., social media, digital platforms, AI/ML) has increasing and substantial impacts on society (e.g., mental health, trust in science, misinformation and polarization, monopolization and industry disruption). Hence, ethical, critical, value-based and political-economy questions are increasingly and necessarily asked about digital IT. Similarly, today‘s pace of innovation may also warrant novel approaches to engaged scholarship and design science. For instance, researchers are calling for methods that can accumulate and update evidence more effectively (Lacity et al. 2021) and better ensure the generalizability of prescriptive knowledge (Brendel et al. 2021; Iivari et al. 2021). This special issue invites contributions that propose, introduce, debate or critique novel quantitative, qualitative or design-oriented methods research, with a focus on the “how” (i.e., origins, processes, steps of the method) and the “why” (e.g., “rigour vs relevance” and “it is new, but is it better” questions) these approaches should be used in IS research. The goal of the special issue is to provide a space for introducing and discussing innovative “next-generation” methods for studying IT-related phenomena, relative to the IS research field. Papers may focus on, but are not restricted to, the following themes: § Critical reflection of research methods used in IS. § Introducing new qualitative, quantitative or design research methods. § Transferability of non-IS research methods such as from other fields or praxis. § Novel combinations of research methods such as cross-disciplinary or mixed-method approaches. § Innovative approaches to analyse big data. § Approaches dealing with special types of unstructured data. § Problems of null hypothesis testing via big data and AI/ML. § AI, ML and explainable AI for knowledge creation and theory generation. \n\n\n§ Transparent, robust and replicable research designs and methodologies. § Transferability and generalizability of insights generated with specific methods. § Approaches to evaluating and communicating practical relevance of findings. § Critical assessment of novel approaches on practical, conceptual, ethical or philosophical grounds. § Philosophy of science-based proposals for or critiques of methods. § Culture and values-driven proposals for or critiques of methods. § Methods to study the past, the present and/or the future. **Submission Guide:** Journal of Information Technology special issue papers will go through no more than two full rounds of peer review.

        "rawContent": " Call for Papers for a Special Issue of the Journal of Information Technology \n\n# Decentralised Information Systems: New Thinking and New Paradigms \n\n**Special Issue Editors: Ali Sunyaev** , Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany (corresponding, sunyaev@kit.edu) **Mary Lacity** , University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, USA **Michel Avital** , Copenhagen Business School, Denmark This special issue seeks to explore and extend the conceptualisation, design, development, implementation and governance of contemporary “decentralised” information systems. “Decentralised” information systems are often seen as an important anti-thesis to “centralised” such systems. Modern societies and economies rely more highly on data, information systems, and technologies than ever. Pioneering organisations brought forth major milestones in developing and providing information technologies (e.g., TCP/IP and the Internet). However, with the significance of information technology increasing over the past decades, a small number of organisations have emerged as “tech giants” (e.g., Alphabet/Google or Meta/Facebook) (Zuboff 2015). Those organisations offer digital services and infrastructures for data processing that gained large-scale adoption by individuals, organisations, governments and society at large. As a result, societies, economies and technical systems became strongly dependent on services from a handful of organisations. The increase of the resulting dependencies leads to a centralisation of information systems. Highly-centralised information systems can result in global organisations and central social actors that abuse their power and pursue their own interests at the expense of others (e.g., by manipulation; Granville 2018), exclude participation from social actors who disagree with them (e.g., by censorship; Zittrain et al. 2017) or invade their privacy through monitoring (e.g., by tracking actions of individuals on the internet; Zuboff 2019). Highlycentralised information systems can also pose several further risks. For example, governance rights– such as rights of access, validation, software updates, data policies, and data overrides— may be centralised with few social actors in control. From a technical perspective, successful attacks on and crashes of central computing devices for network message propagation can interrupt communication in computing systems and even bring about system failures. To avert risks of over-centralization, the purposeful decentralisation of information systems has become a prominent topic of public discourse, for example, around Internet search (e.g., Lobanova 2021; Lomas 2019), cloud computing (e.g., Balanagu 2022; Gaia-X European Association for Data and Cloud AISBL 2023), social media (e.g., Patel 2023; \n\n\nSmith 2023) and financial systems (e.g., Eric Lipton and Ephrat Livni 2022; Wintermeyer 2020). An information system’s degree of decentralisation refers to the degree to which the information system is independent of central actors and technical constructs (Kannengießer et al. 2020; Sunyaev et al. 2021). Several attempts have been made to design decentralised information systems to improve collaboration between actors while reducing dependencies on central authorities. Such endeavours include the development of decentralised token economies based on distributed ledger technology (Sunyaev et al. 2021), decentralised identity management systems (Lacity et al. forthcoming; Lacity and Carmel 2022; Stockburger et al. 2021) and distributed collaborative machine learning systems (e.g., federated learning systems; Rieke et al. 2020). Although information systems decentralisation may resolve several of the above issues of over-centralization, it also comes with its own challenges. For example, maintaining decentralised information systems can become difficult when multiple social actors need to update their technical components independently (Kannengießer et al. 2020). Extensive data replication across technical components in decentralised information systems (e.g., in blockchain systems) can facilitate detecting and exploiting software vulnerabilities (Kannengießer et al. 2021). If too many social actors have opposing ideas, decentralised governance risks never reaching an agreement (Lacity and Lupien 2022; Pfister et al. 2022). When only a few social actors participate in governance, information systems envisioned to be decentralised may de facto centralise. To purposefully achieve the benefits of information system decentralisation, we need to consider both the design of information systems as such and the behaviour of the social actors involved (De Filippi and Loveluck 2016; Pfister et al. 2022). Information systems decentralisation is driven by interdepended economic, political, social and technical factors. As an example of technical factors, the innovation of blockchain technology supports the decentralisation of asset ownership management (Sunyaev et al. 2021). Changes to corporate information system designs, corporate ecosystems, and regulatory refinements are required to facilitate the development and adoption of such technical innovations. Such changes can lead to the centralisation of information systems in other aspects, such as their organisational structures. The entanglement of interdisciplinary factors tightly makes information systems decentralisation an interdisciplinary topic, relevant to several research fields, including computer science (e.g., Miller et al. 2016), organisational studies (e.g., Siggelkow and Levinthal 2003) and information systems (e.g., De Filippi and Loveluck 2016). The interdependence between information system designs and the influence of interdisciplinary factors makes the purposeful decentralisation of information systems an important yet complex undertaking that this special issue seeks new knowledge about. The complexity of information system decentralisation leads to various open questions, such as “how to achieve and sustain appropriate degrees of decentralisation of information systems so that individuals, organisations, and entire business ecosystems can benefit”, “how decentralised enterprise information systems need to be designed”, and “what technical know-how and involvement is required from actors to decentralise information systems appropriately”? \n\n\nThis special issue seeks to improve the understanding of how the various factors affect the decentralisation of information systems used in business and other societal contexts, how different degrees of decentralisation of such information systems emerge over time, and how different degrees of decentralisation of information systems can affect business ecosystems, business processes, and societies overall. We invite applied, empirical, and theoretical research works that investigate information system decentralisation in a way that acknowledges its inter-disciplinary nature and significantly contributes to understanding information system decentralisation, its manifestations, antecedents, and its impact on individuals and organisations, ecosystems and societies. We welcome and encourage submissions from researchers using diverse epistemological and methodological approaches.

                "To avert risks of over-centralization, the purposeful decentralisation of information systems has become a prominent topic of public discourse, for example, around Internet search (e.g., Lobanova 2021; Lomas 2019), cloud computing (e.g., Balanagu 2022; Gaia-X European Association for Data and Cloud AISBL 2023), social media (e.g., Patel 2023; Smith 2023) and financial systems (e.g., Eric Lipton and Ephrat Livni 2022; Wintermeyer 2020). An information system’s degree of decentralisation refers to the degree to which the information system is independent of central actors and technical constructs (Kannengießer et al. 2020; Sunyaev et al. 2021). Several attempts have been made to design decentralised information systems to improve collaboration between actors while reducing dependencies on central authorities. Such endeavours include the development of decentralised token economies based on distributed ledger technology (Sunyaev et al. 2021), decentralised identity management systems (Lacity et al. forthcoming; Lacity and Carmel 2022; Stockburger et al. 2021) and distributed collaborative machine learning systems (e.g., federated learning systems; Rieke et al. 2020).",
                "Although information systems decentralisation may resolve several of the above issues of over-centralization, it also comes with its own challenges. For example, maintaining decentralised information systems can become difficult when multiple social actors need to update their technical components independently (Kannengießer et al. 2020). Extensive data replication across technical components in decentralised information systems (e.g., in blockchain systems) can facilitate detecting and exploiting software vulnerabilities (Kannengießer et al. 2021). If too many social actors have opposing ideas, decentralised governance risks never reaching an agreement (Lacity and Lupien 2022; Pfister et al. 2022). When only a few social actors participate in governance, information systems envisioned to be decentralised may de facto centralise. To purposefully achieve the benefits of information system decentralisation, we need to consider both the design of information systems as such and the behaviour of the social actors involved (De Filippi and Loveluck 2016; Pfister et al. 2022).",
                "Information systems decentralisation is driven by interdepended economic, political, social and technical factors. As an example of technical factors, the innovation of blockchain technology supports the decentralisation of asset ownership management (Sunyaev et al. 2021). Changes to corporate information system designs, corporate ecosystems, and regulatory refinements are required to facilitate the development and adoption of such technical innovations. Such changes can lead to the centralisation of information systems in other aspects, such as their organisational structures. The entanglement of interdisciplinary factors tightly makes information systems decentralisation an interdisciplinary topic, relevant to several research fields, including computer science (e.g., Miller et al. 2016), organisational studies (e.g., Siggelkow and Levinthal 2003) and information systems (e.g., De Filippi and Loveluck 2016). The interdependence between information system designs and the influence of interdisciplinary factors makes the purposeful decentralisation of information systems an important yet complex undertaking that this special issue seeks new knowledge about.",
                "The complexity of information system decentralisation leads to various open questions, such as “how to achieve and sustain appropriate degrees of decentralisation of information systems so that individuals, organisations, and entire business ecosystems can benefit”, “how decentralised enterprise information systems need to be designed”, and “what technical know-how and involvement is required from actors to decentralise information systems appropriately”?",
                "This special issue seeks to improve the understanding of how the various factors affect the decentralisation of information systems used in business and other societal contexts, how different degrees of decentralisation of such information systems emerge over time, and how different degrees of decentralisation of information systems can affect business ecosystems, business processes, and societies overall. We invite applied, empirical, and theoretical research works that investigate information system decentralisation in a way that acknowledges its inter-disciplinary nature and significantly contributes to understanding information system decentralisation, its manifestations, antecedents, and its impact on individuals and organisations, ecosystems and societies. We welcome and encourage submissions from researchers using diverse epistemological and methodological approaches. The manuscripts will be evaluated for the interestingness and novelty of their contributions."

        "rawContent": " Call for Papers for a Special Issue of the Journal of Information Technology on: \n\n# “The Future of Information Systems \n\n# in the Enterprise” \n\n Special Issue Editors: Robert Winter, University of St. Gallen – Switzerland (corresponding, robert.winter@unisg.ch) Karlheinz Kautz, RMIT University – Australia Rajiv Sabherval, University of Arkansas – USA Leona Chandra Kruse, University of Agder – Norway \n\nThe use of information systems in the enterprise is the backbone of digital transformation and digital business, acting as the binding force between technological, managerial, and organizational innovations. The design and use of information systems in the enterprise evolve alongside technological advancements, shifting managerial strategies, and changing organisational forms and needs (Kotusev, 2019). “Enterprise information systems” has been the key term for information systems that transcend narrow functions, processes, products, markets, or concerns (e.g., ERP, SCM, CRM) and integrate these elements, supporting end-toend, creating synergy, and ensuring coherence in the enterprise context (Cao et al., 2022; Robey et al., 2002). Given the rapid pace of change and advancements in emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, edge computing), alternative approaches to information systems used in enterprises (e.g., shadow IT, cloud/as-a-service), and structures beyond single enterprises (e.g., platforms, ecosystems), this special issue is focused on the future of information systems in the enterprise context and deliberately uses this broader term to emphasise our interest in both conventional enterprise information systems and alternative IS/IT solutions used for similar enterprise-level issues. Information systems in the enterprise have undergone fundamental paradigm shifts in the past four decades. First, the integration scope of such systems has expanded to include customer activities, supply chains, and business ecosystems (Ignatiadis & Nandhakumar, 2007; Sambhara et al., 2022). Second, technological innovations have fundamentally changed the characteristics and positioning of information systems in the enterprise. These innovations include, among others, transitioning from on-premises to cloud-based operations, shifting from traditional license to as-a-service models, incorporating analytic and execution functionalities, integrating with or evolving into digital platforms, adopting edge computing, and adding artificial intelligence functionalities (Dong et al., 2009; Flak et al., 2022). These \n\n\ndevelopments set the stage for future challenges, such as how enterprises will further enhance agility and innovation through emerging technologies. Third, managerial innovations require greater flexibility from information systems in the enterprise. These include, among others, the rise of digital platforms and business ecosystems, end-to-end process integration, agile business organization, and continuous development and integration (Aral et al., 2024). Fourth, new types of enterprise systems and other information systems in the enterprise enhance value creation for old and new stakeholders, justifying significant investment while necessitating more sophisticated approaches for their design, development, governance, and operations (see further, Nah et al., 2001; Scott & Vessey, 2002; Dong et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2014; Haki et al., 2020; Mikalef et al., 2020; Flak et al., 2022). \n\nThe future of information systems in the enterprise is complex. IS practice must adapt to technological, managerial, and organizational innovations while IS research may need to integrate insights from work on enterprise systems, enterprise architecture, as well as IS governance, digital transformation, IS sourcing, and digital platforms. This special issue aims to address these challenges by inviting disciplinary and interdisciplinary submissions that provide important insights on the direction and future of information systems in the enterprise. Specifically, “The Future of Information Systems in the Enterprise” special issue seeks to generate new knowledge that addresses key practical or theoretical challenges. Topics of interest include, but certainly are not limited to: \n\n Alternatives to traditional enterprise information systems such as digital platforms, shadow IT, no-code/low-code, and how the challenges they bring for coherent management, and our understanding of enterprise-level systems  Designing future information systems in the enterprise with concerns for both business and societal values  Exploring how technological or organizational innovations in the enterprise / enterpriselevel context challenge and extend existing knowledge and theory  Extending and adapting the body of knowledge to encompass specific contexts, such as strategies, industries, ecosystems, or specific organizational configurations  Horizontal (cross-unit) and vertical (technology-to-business) integration through information systems in the enterprise  Specific integration challenges of technology, organization, and humans in the enterprise / enterprise-level context  Intersection of artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies in information systems in the enterprise  Intersection/relation of enterprise and platform/ecosystem-level systems and technologies, and the corresponding challenges such as for organizational strategy  Understanding and harnessing the complexity of enterprise computing \n\n\nContributing to this special issue is an opportunity to shape the future of enterprise information systems and influence industry practices and academic understanding. We welcome research from all genres on the above and related topics, including conceptual, qualitative, quantitative and design-oriented work. \n\nEditorial Board: \n\n- Pär Ågerfalk, Uppsala University, Sweden \n\n- Rainer Alt, University of Leipzig, Germany \n\n- Vanessa Cooper, RMIT University Melbourne, Australia \n\n- Rob Gleasure, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark \n\n- Kazem Haki, HES Geneva, Switzerland \n\n- Taha Havakhor, McGill University, Canada \n\n- Hartmut Hoehle, University of Mannheim, Germany \n\n- Sherah Kurnia, University of Melbourne, Australia \n\n- Carmen Leong, UNSW, Australia \n\n- Jan Mendling, Humboldt-Universität, Germany \n\n- Annette Mills, University of Canterbury, New Zealand \n\n- Petter Nielsen, University of Oslo, Norway \n\n- Ralf Plattfaut, University Duisburg-Essen, Germany \n\n- Matti Rossi, Aalto University, Finland \n\n- Helana Scheepers, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia \n\n- Priya Seetharaman, Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India \n\n- Pankaj Setia, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India \n\n- Matthias Söllner, University of Kassel, Germany \n\n- Zach Steelman, University of Arkansas, USA \n\n- Tuure Tuunanen, University of Jyväskylä, Finland \n\nTimeline:  Extended abstract submissions via email to the corresponding special issue editor by 1 November 2024 for early feedback and invitation to the special issue paper development workshop.

        "rawContent": " Journal of Management Information Systems (JMIS) \n\n Call for Submission to the Special Issue \n\n Fostering the Design and Governance of the Metaverse Guest Editors: Prof. Paul Benjamin Lowry, Virginia Tech; Prof. Waifong Boh, Nanyang Technological University; Prof. Stacie Petter, Wake Forest University; Prof. Jan Marco Leimeister, University of St. Gallen and University of Kassel JMIS, a top-tier scholarly journal, invites the best papers addressing the components of the potential emergence of the Metaverse as a complement to and a potential replacement for the current Web. \n\nThe Metaverse is envisioned as a collection of technologies and initiatives intended to create a nextgeneration Internet (Web3) that is highly immersive, persistent, in 3D, and based on the latest developments in extended reality (XR)—an umbrella term for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR)—as supplemented by artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, quantum computing, and other supporting technologies. Given the compelling and disruptive potential for the Metaverse to generate the Web3, several of the world’s leading technology companies are investing tens of billions of dollars on related software and hardware to foster this market, including Meta (famously renamed from “Facebook” as an all-in bet on the Metaverse), Microsoft, Snapchat, Amazon, NVIDIA, Epic Games, Apple, among others. \n\nThis is an opportune time for researchers to examine what can be learned from the past failed efforts of AR/VR platforms such as Second Life and over-hyped failed AR technologies like Google Glass, and to examine the many more successes that are occurring, perhaps more quietly, with XR (i.e., VR, MR, AR) in education, manufacturing, gaming, branding, healthcare, retailing, logistics, aerospace and defense, architecture, advertising, and athletics. It is these successes and disruptive business models that are likely to form what will be known as the Metaverse. However, this is no minor feat, just as the Internet as we know it took decades to develop. To create a truly persistent 3D, virtual, and immersive Metaverse, there will need to be further advances in supporting hardware (goggles, headsets, sensors), and an exponential increase in computing power, storage, and memory. If the Metaverse is to succeed it must be based on making things better for people than the status quo, and thus must foster innovative business models that are profitable, and yet foster interoperability, efficiency, remote work, reliability, fairness, accountability, open governance, inclusivity, safety, community, and to do so in a manner that is sustainable environmentally, socially and ethically. \n\nThis is the time for scientists to work with policy makers, companies, and not-for-profit organizations to break the current social media models and envision a Metaverse that can best serve collective global needs. \n\nAccordingly, we are pleased to announce a Special Issue (SI) on this subject at **_JMIS_**. Importantly, information systems (IS) researchers have long contributed to the foundational research that can serve as building blocks for the Metaverse, including but not limited to XR (i.e., VR, AR, MR), avatars, agents, gamification, and gaming [1-4, 7-19, 21-28, 30-32]. Meanwhile, IS researchers are presently leading key research on the Metaverse itself [5, 6, 20, 29]. Our strong preference is for contributions of original and rigorous theory-guided behavioral or empirical data around information systems artifacts that inform design, practice, research, and the products and foundations of theory of meaningful aspects of the Metaverse. We seek any methodological approaches that are legitimate and rigorous, and that can shed light on important phenomena related to the Metaverse. However, we are not seeking review papers or those that focus on discussions of further research alone. \n\n\nThe following are example of research areas, questions, topics, and controversies in the Metaverse emergence on which we are soliciting papers: \n\n**Stages leading to the Metaverse:** Right now, the Metaverse is hypothetical, and no one owns or controls it and many of the pieces already exist in terms of XR, AI, and hardware interfaces. The Metaverse is also not dichotomous (i.e., it exists, or it does not) but instead, it is likely to unfold in stages over time, just as the Internet as we know it unfolded over time. We thus look for further understanding of the process and intermediate stages that are likely to bring about the collective vision of the Metaverse. The integration of quantum computing into the Internet, as the computing power required for the massive VR is estimated to be 10,000 times greater than what the present supercomputers can deliver. There is also a possibility of various “metaverses” integrating with each other, such as through gaming platforms. We thus ask, how do we get the Metaverse to scale such that it is viable with compelling network effects, and what are the stages? \n\n**Applications of the Metaverse (i.e.,** **_meta-apps_** **):** What are the serious applications of the Metaverse that can drive innovation through novel business models that add value, and what are the implications in terms of job redefinition, organizational impact, industry transformation, inclusion, and sustainability? Is there a “killer” app for the Metaverse? How can we learn from failure such that the Metaverse can result in a dramatic improvement on earlier attempts at immersive combinations of AR and VR, such as Second Life? Related topics include: Collaboration and teamwork; gamification; higher education and corporate training; _meta-commerce_ (Metaverse ecommerce and advertising); _meta-conferencing_ (rethinking teleconferences); _meta-crowdsourcing_ (expanding crowdsourcing to the Metaverse); _meta-fitness_ (immersive fitness apps); _meta-healthcare_ (medical applications of the Metaverse); _meta-socialization_ (re-envisioning social networks and social media); _meta-hospitability_ (Metaverse applications of travel, hospitability, and tourism); virtual objects trading; and _meta-platforms_ (platform-based business models based on the Metaverse). \n\n**Governance of the Metaverse (i.e.,** **_meta-governance_** **)** : How will a properly governed Metaverse work in terms of issues around identity, ownership, accountability, responsibility, and interoperability standards? Is it possible to govern the Metaverse in a sustainable manner ( _meta-sustainability_ )? Who decides what the standards are and what is allowed and not allowed? Key related topics include the following: Agents, avatar autonomy, avatars and personal identity, virtual identity, blockchain standards, content co-creation and ownership, copyright and trademarks, cryptocurrency standards, development of free open standards, governance of digital twins, intellectual property, interoperability, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and virtual environment development standardization. \n\n**Challenges to security and privacy on the Metaverse (i.e.,** **_meta-cybersecurity_** **)** : The Metaverse will surely foster commonly known issues around privacy, security, trust, distrust, and cybercrime, but what are the related potential contemporary issues it is likely to generate and how can these be studied and thwarted? What are the implications for government and organizational cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) programs? Related topics include the following: Accountability, authentication, censorship, computer abuse, cybercrime, counter-intelligence, cyber frauds, CTI programs, deception, deep fakes, fake news, _metaconsent_ (informed consent on the Metaverse), security and privacy implications of _meta-apps_ ; and new forms of identity theft, malware and social engineering attacks, organized crime, privacy policies and consent, privacy issues from wearable device biometric, haptic, and sensor technologies, and security and privacy of digital twins. \n\n**Dark unintended consequences of the Metaverse (i.e.,** **_meta-deviance_** **):** Aside from security and privacy issues, the Metaverse will provide an expansive platform on which existing and new forms of dark and deviant behavior may thrive. How can we prevent the issues that pervade present Web and social media \n\n\nplatforms from exponentially infecting the Metaverse? What are the negative ramifications of and unintended consequences of the Metaverse and how can these be measured, studied, and thwarted? Related topics include: Addiction, anxiety, bigotry and hate, cyber predators, cyberbullying, cyberharassment, depression, deviance, escapism, exploitation and unfairness, fostering sedentary lifestyles, illegal pornography, lack of diversity, loneliness, meta-divide (digital divide worsened by the Metaverse), technostress, and virtual sexual abuse. \n\n**Designing immersive, interactive, and persistent 3D Metaverse applications** ( **i.e.,** **_meta-interactivity_** ): The Metaverse will challenge and expand what we know about interactivity, immersion, and humancomputer interaction (HCI), in light of the aims to make the Metaverse a 3D persistent environment that integrates digital twins, headsets, haptic technologies, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, computer vision, and sensors—as supported by high-end edge computing and the latest AI/ML techniques. Accordingly, many of the known constructs, measures, theories, and techniques in the HCI space need to be rethought, expanded, or replaced, especially to address the wide range of systems use and goals—from hedonic uses, to mixed uses, and utilitarian uses. Related key topics include: Adoption, technology affordances, _metaaffordances_ (design affordances specific to the Metaverse and supporting haptic and biometric technologies), appropriate challenge, achieving extended reality (XR) (through VR, AR, MR), avatars, cognitive absorption, cognitive load, computer vision, connected IoT devices, connected vehicles, continuance, discontinuance, embodiment, empathy, engagement, feedback cues, flow, gamified design, immersion, leveraging digital twins, mental workload, navigability, sensory overload, tactile perceptions, telepresence, usability, visual cues, and wholistic scene understanding. \n\n**Dates:** \n\n- First round submissions due date: **June 30, 2023** \n\n- First round decisions provided by: **September 15, 2023** \n\n- Second round submissions due date: **January 15, 2024** \n\n- Second round decisions provided by: **March 15, 2024** \n\n- Third round submissions due date: **May 15, 2024** \n\n- Final decisions on papers provided by: **July 30, 2024** \n\n- Special issue publication TBD in late 2024 or early 2025 \n\nPlease **do not** contact the editors directly, but instead send abstracts, queries, and submissions to **JMISmetaverse2023@gmail.com** \n\n**Honorary Senior Scholar advisors and editors to the special issue:** \n\n- Patrick Y.K.

                "JMIS, a top-tier scholarly journal, invites the best papers addressing the components of the potential emergence of the Metaverse as a complement to and a potential replacement for the current Web. The Metaverse is envisioned as a collection of technologies and initiatives intended to create a next-generation Internet (Web3) that is highly immersive, persistent, in 3D, and based on the latest developments in extended reality (XR)—an umbrella term for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR)—as supplemented by artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, quantum computing, and other supporting technologies. Given the compelling and disruptive potential for the Metaverse to generate the Web3, several of the world’s leading technology companies are investing tens of billions of dollars on related software and hardware to foster this market, including Meta, Microsoft, Snapchat, Amazon, NVIDIA, Epic Games, Apple, among others.",
                "This is an opportune time for researchers to examine what can be learned from the past failed efforts of AR/VR platforms such as Second Life and over-hyped failed AR technologies like Google Glass, and to examine the many more successes that are occurring, perhaps more quietly, with XR in education, manufacturing, gaming, branding, healthcare, retailing, logistics, aerospace and defense, architecture, advertising, and athletics. It is these successes and disruptive business models that are likely to form what will be known as the Metaverse. However, this is no minor feat, just as the Internet as we know it took decades to develop. To create a truly persistent 3D, virtual, and immersive Metaverse, there will need to be further advances in supporting hardware (goggles, headsets, sensors), and an exponential increase in computing power, storage, and memory. If the Metaverse is to succeed it must be based on making things better for people than the status quo, and thus must foster innovative business models that are profitable, and yet foster interoperability, efficiency, remote work, reliability, fairness, accountability, open governance, inclusivity, safety, community, and to do so in a manner that is sustainable environmentally, socially and ethically.",
                "This is the time for scientists to work with policy makers, companies, and not-for-profit organizations to break the current social media models and envision a Metaverse that can best serve collective global needs.",
                "Accordingly, we are pleased to announce a Special Issue on this subject at JMIS. Importantly, information systems (IS) researchers have long contributed to the foundational research that can serve as building blocks for the Metaverse, including but not limited to XR (i.e., VR, AR, MR), avatars, agents, gamification, and gaming. Meanwhile, IS researchers are presently leading key research on the Metaverse itself. Our strong preference is for contributions of original and rigorous theory-guided behavioral or empirical data around information systems artifacts that inform design, practice, research, and the products and foundations of theory of meaningful aspects of the Metaverse. We seek any methodological approaches that are legitimate and rigorous, and that can shed light on important phenomena related to the Metaverse. However, we are not seeking review papers or those that focus on discussions of further research alone."

The Mental Health America society estimated that nearly a fifth of the adult US population suffered a mental illness in 2019-2020 and that 94% of these individuals did not receive any treatment [6]. Information Technology (IT) such as wearables, digital pills, cope notes, VR, and others have been proposed and used to help address the growing mental health crisis. However, the understanding of the design, development, adoption, use, and impact of such technologies for diagnosing and treating mental health illnesses remains nascent. Information Systems (IS) scholars are starting to study various aspects of mental health, including occupational stress [1,3,5,8], distress [2,7], and diagnosable mental health disorders [4,9]. However, significant areas of opportunity remain for developing and evaluating digital technologies that could help identify or tackle anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social anxiety), mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), and addiction (e.g., substance abuse, chemical dependence). This Special Section seeks to expand research related to IT for mental health and spearhead an ongoing research agenda related to this subject in the IS discipline. We are specifically seeking contributions that improve our understanding of how IT could be leveraged to _identify mental health conditions and improve_ mental health. We encourage a wide range of content, including theory, qualitative and quantitative approaches, and design science for mental health for this Special Section. Example topics within the scope of this special section include, but are not limited to: \n\n- Impact of IT designed to prevent, diagnose, and treat mental health issues \n\n- Design, development, and evaluation of new artifacts for identifying mental health     conditions from social media \n\n- Improving mental health with Metaverse-related technologies \n\n- Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and related sensor signal analysis-based approaches     for identifying depressive behaviors \n\n- AI systems to identify individuals in mental duress \n\n- AI systems to recommend mental health interventions \n\n- Automated identification of mental health progression \n\n- Mental health intervention program development and deployment \n\n- Adoption of mental health IT \n\n- New theories around IT use and deployment for mental health \n\n\n- Role of IT in improving mental health services \n\n- Human-AI interfaces to support mental health decision-making processes \n\n- IT for improving mental health for specific demographics or socioeconomic status \n\n- Bias in IT for mental health Irrespective of the topic, the focus on how IT is being used or developed to identify mental health conditions or improve mental health should be evident (IT is a central theme of the paper). Research that examines the negative impacts of technology (e.g., antecedents to technostress) do not fit the theme. We welcome research that uses or employs various types of methods and analysis, including: \n\n- Qualitative methods, including interviews and observations \n\n- Quantitative methods, including experiments and surveys \n\n- Archival and observational research methods \n\n- Mixed methods research \n\n- Design science research \n\n- Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled analytics methods, including machine learning, deep     learning, text mining, and network science **Timeline:** Authors should submit a two-page extended abstract to the Guest Editors prior to submission to assess the fit of their paper with the special section. The abstract should clearly present the research question, theory, method and expected contribution. Authors are encouraged to submit prior to the deadline and papers will be processed as they are received. The editorial timeline will proceed as follows: \n\n- **Expression of Interest** : March 1, 2023 (two-page abstract, single spaced, 1 2 point font) \n\n- **Initial Submission Due:** July 31 , 2023 \n\n- **Notification of First Round Decision:** November 30 , 2023 \n\n- **1 st**^ **Resubmission Due:** March 30 , 202 4 \n\n- **Notification of Second Round Decision:** June 30 , 2024 \n\n- **2 nd**^ **Resubmission Due:** September 30 , 2024 \n\n- **Final Decision:** December 30 , 2024 **Submission Information** All submissions (including abstracts) will use Precision Conferences.

However, significant areas of opportunity remain for developing and evaluating digital technologies that could help identify or tackle anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social anxiety), mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), and addiction (e.g., substance abuse, chemical dependence). This Special Section seeks to expand research related to IT for mental health and spearhead an ongoing research agenda related to this subject in the IS discipline. We are specifically seeking contributions that improve our understanding of how IT could be leveraged to identify mental health conditions and improve mental health. We encourage a wide range of content, including theory, qualitative and quantitative approaches, and design science for mental health for this Special Section.",
                "Irrespective of the topic, the focus on how IT is being used or developed to identify mental health conditions or improve mental health should be evident (IT is a central theme of the paper). Research that examines the negative impacts of technology (e.g., antecedents to technostress) do not fit the theme. We welcome research that uses or employs various types of methods and analysis, including qualitative methods, including interviews and observations; quantitative methods, including experiments and surveys; archival and observational research methods; mixed methods research; design science research; and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled analytics methods, including machine learning, deep learning, text mining, and network science."

Unlike previous generations of AI systems, which were primarily designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, Generative AI synthesizes the data it has been trained on and creates content in the form of images, text, audio, video, and more that is similar to content created by human experts – but in much less time, at a fraction of the cost, and with amazing creativity. In this special issue, we focus on the opportunities and challenges that Generative AI poses for digital platforms. Over the past two decades, social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube, mobile app platforms such as Apple’s App Store, e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, freelance platforms such as Upwork, and sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb and Uber have reshaped and disrupted entire industries. What these platform companies have in common is that they create value by facilitating interactions and the exchange of goods and services between two or more groups that would have been difficult or impossible to connect in the absence of the platform [8, 13]. Information systems (IS) scholars have made important contributions to the literature on digital platforms [e.g., 6, 10, 11, 14, 1821], much of which has been focused on the complex relationship between the triumvirate of users, complementors (i.e., those who contribute content to the platforms such as app developers or video creators), and the platform provider, which together form the platform ecosystem. In the context of digital platforms, all stakeholders, and their interactions with one another, can be transformed by Generative AI. For example, Generative AI can enable unprecedented forms of personalization (i.e., hyper-personalization), allowing complementors to instantly tailor their offerings to meet the preferences of each individual user. However, complementors in particular may also feel threatened by the technology’s disruptive potential. For instance, research has shown that the introduction of a Generative AI system on a crowdsourcing platform can motivate complementors to either leave the platform or shift their efforts to more complex contests to avoid competing directly with the new system [9]. While all platform stakeholders can draw on Generative AI to save countless hours of human labor and enhance the user experience in various platform settings, we are only beginning to understand the transformative value of the technology for digital platforms. Especially since the introduction of ChatGPT 3 by OpenAI in 2022, Generative AI is experiencing rapid growth, with Gartner [7] predicting that 30% of outbound messages will be synthetically generated by 2025. As a major paradigm shift, Generative AI will continue to revolutionize the way we use, govern, and understand digital platforms, creating a wealth of opportunities for individuals, teams, organizations, and society. However, there are also concerns that Generative AI will lead to job displacement, as the technology becomes capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans [22]. \n\n\nIS researchers have contributed important insights on fundamental questions regarding the implications of AI for business as well as how the technology could and should be managed [2]. However, with the emergence of Generative AI, new research avenues are opening up, providing an opportunity for IS scholars to conduct leading research on the transformative and value-creating capacity of this fascinating technology, especially with regard to digital platforms [e.g., 9]. As a disruptive technology, Generative AI can enable truly innovative services and business models that engage all platform stakeholders in unprecedented ways. It could disrupt entire platform industries, sending them into a downward spiral while providing groundbreaking opportunities for others. Despite this promise as a game changer, the interplay between the Generative AI’s inherent potential and its transformative value for digital platforms is poorly understood and requires further research. This is an area where IS scholars are wellequipped to contribute to the discussion through cutting-edge research. \n\n## Focus \n\nRather than addressing the operational and tactical merits of Generative AI, this special issue provides a dedicated forum for IS and other scholars to engage in an important dialogue on its strategic and managerial implications. In particular, we are interested in the transformative value of Generative AI for digital platforms and the impact of Generative AI on the various stakeholders in a digital platform ecosystem, including complementors, users, and platform providers. **_I. The transformative value of Generative AI for complementors_** Generative AI is changing the way complementors deliver products and services. Beyond being a more advanced personalization tool, the use of Generative AI in digital platforms raises questions about how it affects the role, strategies, and capabilities of complementors over time as well as the competition among them [e.g., 16, 24]. For instance, the technology may lower barriers to entry by shortening development times and enabling even novice complementors without technical backgrounds to engage in tasks such as app development, potentially increasing competition among complementors. And more broadly, Generative AI can contribute to transforming entire business models [e.g., 4, 23]. How will complementors differentiate themselves when all textual, visual, and audio content is created by Generative AI? What is the role of humans as value creators in this world? Which complementors will be most affected? **_II. The transformative value of Generative AI for users_** Generative AI can provide platform users with powerful creative tools that promise productivity gains in the creation of content, such as text, images, and music [12]. These are just three examples of highly extensible formats that Generative AI can drastically influence, with serious implications for how users organize and improve their platform activities [e.g., 19]. This will enable users to create high-quality content with minimal effort, making it easier for them to express themselves and share their ideas with others. In turn, this could further blur the lines between consumers and creators of content and services on digital platforms, as the skill barrier to create is significantly reduced. With easier entry to become a complementor, it can also be of interest to see how users react to products and services created using Generative AI. Will the perception of quality be altered by the disclosure of the usage of AI [15]? What consequences with regard to competition and differentiation can be observed in platform markets? **_III. The transformative value of Generative AI for platform providers_** As Generative AI changes how users and complementors act and interact, so does the platform where the interaction happens. While Generative AI empowers users, the resulting dynamics and complexities in the complements and interactions need to be evaluated and considered, including business and ethical limitations (e.g., privacy, copyright, unethical applications, fraud detection) [e.g., 1, 3]. In the same vein, Generative AI may be used as a means to improve governance and orchestration of digital platforms [e.g., 5]. Despite these realities, we know little about how platform providers can manage and control the employment and use of Generative AI to create flourishing ecosystems, increase alignment between all stakeholders, and build (more or less open) value networks to integrate with upstream and downstream partners along future platform chains. \n\n\n**_IV. The societal and economic effects of Generative AI_** The transformative value of Generative AI presents major opportunities, while also raising concerns about its broader societal and economic effects. For instance, the technology can stimulate innovation and aid the development of new products and services. However, it could also contribute to job displacement, as machines take over tasks previously done by humans. Additionally, Generative AI could exacerbate existing inequalities in society by favoring those who have access to the technology, leading to a new digital divide. There are also concerns about the ethical implications of using Generative AI, including issues related to data privacy, bias (e.g., biased training data), and accountability. It is thus essential to study the societal and economic effects of Generative AI to ensure that its benefits are maximized while minimizing its potential harms. We therefore also explicitly invite research that considers humanistic outcome variables (e.g., emotional and mental well-being of individuals and society) rather than focusing strictly on efficiency and productivity perspectives [17]. \n\n## Possible Topics \n\nThe focus of this special issue is to stimulate innovative investigation of the transformative value of Generative AI for digital platforms at or between all levels of analysis. Digital platforms should be the empirical setting. All lenses of inquiry into the disruptive nature and impact of Generative AI for digital platforms are encouraged, including strategic, organizational, behavioral, economic, and technical perspectives. We welcome theoretical, analytical, and empirical (including trace data from platforms, surveys, experiments, simulations, qualitative data, case studies, and secondary data from organizational, market, and regulatory sources) contributions to the special issue. Consistent with the policies of JMIS, the papers should aim to make a significant novel contribution to the IS field. **_Possible research areas include, but are not limited to:_** § Accessibility: The role of Generative AI in enhancing accessibility and inclusion on digital platforms. Does Generative AI reduce barriers to express oneself and enable more active user participation? § Empowerment: Generative AI and its value for the democratization and empowerment of marginalized groups (e.g., skills, costs, language barriers, technological compatibility). § Complementors: How do complementors react to the introduction of Generative AI on platforms? Does it increase competition among complementors? How do communities react to content that is generated by AI? § Automated content creation: Use of Generative AI to automate content creation on digital platforms, thereby reducing costs while trying to maintain quality. For example, automatic creation of product descriptions, reviews, and other content indistinguishable from human-created content. § Human engagement in Generative AI: Training and updating Generative AI to achieve better results for digital platforms. Technology affordances of AI and their practical socio-technical design principles. § Business model and value proposition: Generative AI can possibly alter a platform’s business model that used to rely on content that is produced by complementors. How is the business model and value proposition affected when content can largely be generated “artificially”? § Generative AI as a platform: Many new Generative AI systems offer boundary resources such as APIs. What new business models emerge from a platform-based AI? § Network effects: How can Generative AI help to kickstart and maintain network effects? The role of Generative AI in overcoming the “chicken-and-egg” problem. For example, Generative AI as social bots replacing users. § Competition between digital platforms: Does Generative AI level the playing field between rival platforms or does it intensify “winner-take-all” dynamics? § Platform governance and openness: How do boundary resources change to compensate for automatic content creation? How is platform governance adjusted to accommodate AI-generated content? \n\n\n§ Society and goverments: What are the consequences of Generative AI beyond digital platforms? How is society affected? What can and should governments do? § User experience: The impact of Generative AI on user engagement, satisfaction, and experience on digital platforms. Also, reaction to, approval of, and willingness to pay for AI-generated content. § Humanistic outcomes: The role of Generative AI for the emotional and mental well-being of users and society beyond efficiency and productivity outcomes (e.g., income inequality, government corruption, and overreach). § Personalized content: The potential of Generative AI to create personalized content and enhance the relevance of recommendations and search results. For example, personal product recommendations for each user based on their past purchases and browsing history. Do Generative AI features such as hyper-personalization lead to stronger lock-ins due to higher switching costs? § Ethical considerations: The ethical implications of using Generative AI on digital platforms, including the risks associated with the creation of fake news, deepfakes, and misinformation. For example, how is the spread and “quality” of misinformation affected using Generative AI. \n\n## Special Issue Advisory and Editorial Board \n\n§ Carmelo Cennamo, Copenhagen Business School § Panos Constantinides, The University of Manchester § Oliver Hinz, Goethe University Frankfurt § Kai-Lung Hui, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology § Robert J.

For instance, research has shown that the introduction of a Generative AI system on a crowdsourcing platform can motivate complementors to either leave the platform or shift their efforts to more complex contests to avoid competing directly with the new system."

Platforms are strategic in enabling value co-creation through boundary resources—such as software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs)—which provide complementors with the tools needed to seamlessly integrate their offerings into the core platform infrastructure&nbsp;(Eaton et al. 2015; Ghazawneh and Henfridsson 2013; Mann et al. 2022; Schreieck et al. 2022; Zapadka et al. 2022).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Guest editors:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://faculty.essec.edu/en/cv/huber-thomas/\">Thomas Huber</a>&nbsp;(ESSEC Business School, France) &lt;<u>huber@essec.edu</u>&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.uibk.ac.at/wipl/team/team/schreieck.html.en\">Maximilian Schreieck</a>&nbsp;(University of Innsbruck, Austria) &lt;<u>Maximilian.Schreieck@uibk.ac.at</u>&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.unisg.ch/en/university/about-us/organisation/detail/person-id/7d080ea7-3201-466e-ab31-95caeba295e7/\">Andreas Hein</a>&nbsp;(University of St Gallen, Switzerland) &lt;<u>andreas.hein@unisg.ch</u>&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/ilan-oshri\">Ilan Oshri</a>&nbsp;(University of Auckland, New Zealand) &lt;<u>ilan.oshri@auckland.ac.nz</u>&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/j-kotlarsky\">Julia Kotlarsky</a>&nbsp;(University of Auckland, New Zealand) &lt;<u>j.kotlarsky@auckland.ac.nz</u>&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Special issue information:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Novel and creative uses of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), low-code/no-code platforms, and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) like blockchain are redefining how organizations interact, collaborate, and compete. AI and IoT enable real-time data analytics and predictive insights, allowing platforms to coordinate relationships and optimize sourcing decisions by anticipating demand, managing risks, and adjusting partnerships&nbsp;(Gregory et al. 2020; Shollo et al. 2022). IoT enhances this by providing continuous data streams from connected devices, enabling more responsive, data-driven collaborations in logistics and inventory management&nbsp;(Pauli et al. 2021). Low-code/no-code platforms reduce entry barriers for participants, enabling organizations to develop solutions independently&nbsp;(Bock and Frank 2021; Viljoen et al. 2024). Blockchain and smart contracts automate partnership agreements through self-executing code, reducing transaction costs and fostering trust, particularly in complex, cross-border environments&nbsp;(Ellinger et al. 2023).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, these technologies have strategic implications on partnerships in platform ecosystems, potentially reshaping established practices in value co-creation and appropriation&nbsp;(Li and Tuunanen 2022), and sourcing arrangements&nbsp;(Oshri et al. 2015). While they offer complementors opportunities to innovate and gain leverage, they also equip platform owners with new tools to reinforce their dominance. Whether these new tools will benefit complementors or increase platform owners' control remains an open question. For example, as decentralized, real-time decision-making becomes more common, will these technologies empower complementors to innovate and operate autonomously, or will they reinforce existing power imbalances, allowing platform owners to strengthen centralized control&nbsp;and&nbsp;dictate terms of value appropriation and collaboration&nbsp;(Cutolo and Kenney 2021; Huber et al. 2017; Hurni et al. 2022)?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As dominant platform owners like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in Western markets, and Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in China, continue to control key sectors of consumer and business markets&nbsp;(Chatterjee and Sarker 2024), complementors face growing challenges in navigating the advantages of platform participation against the risks of dependency and lock-in, both undermining complementor autonomy&nbsp;(Kude and Huber forthcoming; Engert et al. 2023;&nbsp;Cutolo and Kenney 2021; Engert et al. forthcoming; Hurni et al. 2022). Meanwhile, the evolving regulatory landscape, such as the European Union’s (EU) Digital Markets Act<a href=\"https://star.elsevier.net/admin/tasks/#_ftn1\"><span>[1]</span></a>, seeks to address these power imbalances by imposing restrictions on platform gatekeepers that reshape partner strategies and value co-creation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, platform partnerships are undergoing significant strategic transformations&nbsp;(Zapadka et al. 2022). Advancements in technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, along with shifts in political and regulatory environments, are influencing how partnerships within platform ecosystems evolve&nbsp;(Kude and Huber forthcoming; Schreieck et al. 2024). In this rapidly changing landscape, critical questions arise about the future dynamics of partnerships in platform ecosystems. How will the balance between value co-creation and value appropriation shift as AI, DLT, and IoT become more integrated into platform partnerships? Will these technologies empower complementors to innovate and capture a fair share of the value they create, or will they enable platform owners to centralize control, deepening dependencies and shifting value appropriation in their favor? And as platform ecosystems often narture sourcing relationships, how and in what ways sourcing relationships between a platform owner and complementors affect the platform ecosystem? Ultimately, how can both platform owners and complementors strategically navigate these changes to ensure mutual benefit in an increasingly complex ecosystem?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This call for papers invites research that explores how these strategic shifts are reshaping platform partnerships, including changes in the strategies and business models of platform owners and complementors&nbsp;(Böttcher et al. 2022), and the governance of these partnerships and ecosystems&nbsp;(Huber et al. 2017; Wareham et al. 2014). We welcome empirical, conceptual<a href=\"https://star.elsevier.net/admin/tasks/#_ftn2\"><span>[2]</span></a>, design, and simulation research.

            "paragraphs": [
                "Over the last years platform partnerships between independent third-party developers (complementors) and providers of software platforms (platform owners) have become the prevailing model for developing and delivering software products and services. Platforms are strategic in enabling value co-creation through boundary resources—such as software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs)—which provide complementors with the tools needed to seamlessly integrate their offerings into the core platform infrastructure.",
                "Novel and creative uses of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), low-code/no-code platforms, and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) like blockchain are redefining how organizations interact, collaborate, and compete. AI and IoT enable real-time data analytics and predictive insights, allowing platforms to coordinate relationships and optimize sourcing decisions by anticipating demand, managing risks, and adjusting partnerships. IoT enhances this by providing continuous data streams from connected devices, enabling more responsive, data-driven collaborations in logistics and inventory management. Low-code/no-code platforms reduce entry barriers for participants, enabling organizations to develop solutions independently. Blockchain and smart contracts automate partnership agreements through self-executing code, reducing transaction costs and fostering trust, particularly in complex, cross-border environments.",
                "Together, these technologies have strategic implications on partnerships in platform ecosystems, potentially reshaping established practices in value co-creation and appropriation, and sourcing arrangements. While they offer complementors opportunities to innovate and gain leverage, they also equip platform owners with new tools to reinforce their dominance. Whether these new tools will benefit complementors or increase platform owners' control remains an open question. For example, as decentralized, real-time decision-making becomes more common, will these technologies empower complementors to innovate and operate autonomously, or will they reinforce existing power imbalances, allowing platform owners to strengthen centralized control and dictate terms of value appropriation and collaboration?",
                "As dominant platform owners like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in Western markets, and Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in China, continue to control key sectors of consumer and business markets, complementors face growing challenges in navigating the advantages of platform participation against the risks of dependency and lock-in, both undermining complementor autonomy. Meanwhile, the evolving regulatory landscape, such as the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, seeks to address these power imbalances by imposing restrictions on platform gatekeepers that reshape partner strategies and value co-creation.",
                "Indeed, platform partnerships are undergoing significant strategic transformations. Advancements in technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, along with shifts in political and regulatory environments, are influencing how partnerships within platform ecosystems evolve. In this rapidly changing landscape, critical questions arise about the future dynamics of partnerships in platform ecosystems. How will the balance between value co-creation and value appropriation shift as AI, DLT, and IoT become more integrated into platform partnerships? Will these technologies empower complementors to innovate and capture a fair share of the value they create, or will they enable platform owners to centralize control, deepening dependencies and shifting value appropriation in their favor? And as platform ecosystems often nurture sourcing relationships, how and in what ways sourcing relationships between a platform owner and complementors affect the platform ecosystem? Ultimately, how can both platform owners and complementors strategically navigate these changes to ensure mutual benefit in an increasingly complex ecosystem?",
                "This call for papers invites research that explores how these strategic shifts are reshaping platform partnerships, including changes in the strategies and business models of platform owners and complementors, and the governance of these partnerships and ecosystems. We welcome empirical, conceptual, design, and simulation research. Any methodologies and theoretical perspectives are encouraged as long as they contribute to the theoretical understanding of platform partnerships, along with practical insights."

The education systems along with several other services for citizens, including public administration, healthcare etc. followed suit (Marabelli et al. 2021). In a sense, the COVID-19 pandemic served as an unintended natural experiment, testing the extent to which current technologies are able to support remote/virtual interactions via immersive platforms. At the same time, the pandemic also exposed limitations of these arrangements, setting the groundwork for novel ways (and technologies) to promote further such interactions in the future. <br><br>Most knowledge workers were already used to working remotely, at least occasionally, working from home, in virtual teams and on-line communities. Engagement in on-line meetings for prolonged periods of time, and sometimes overnight, was a disruptive change that left knowledge workers longing for a return to more in-person interactions. In healthcare, telecare was seldom used before the pandemic. Yet, when regular in-person visits became impossible, the industry adapted to the new realities and, as an example, in the US in 2021, telehealth services had been used 38 times more often than before the start of the pandemic (Marr 2022). Since then, most in-person healthcare operations have resumed. Similarly in the education sector, primary and secondary schools resumed in-person classes in most countries (China being a partial exception), as vaccines became available, and the effects of the pandemic faded. Higher education institutions, however, behaved differently. The already diffused offering of remote classes and curricula saw the pandemic as an opportunity to consolidate the on-line education industry, a development that is most likely here to stay (Lockee 2021). Looking at higher education from a researcher perspective, on-line meetings are certainly more common in the aftermath of the pandemic, along with conferences and workshops often being run in hybrid mode, albeit with mixed results (Marabelli et al. 2023).<br><br>In sum, COVID-19 forced several industries to systematically adopt technologies and practices to work, interact and collaborate remotely. The pandemic also gave high-tech companies the push to develop new systems supporting on-line interactions in a supposedly more effective fashion. For instance, Meta, in 2021, had already invested over $10B in metaverse-related projects (Brown 2021). In January 2022, Microsoft invested $68.7B in the metaverse by acquiring Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a gaming and virtual reality company (Microsoft 2022). According to Matthew Ball’s (2021) definition, the metaverse is “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.” The metaverse is different from other collaborative platforms because of its immersiveness, meaning that the 3D technical features, along with the use of avatars and devices such as headsets and other types of sensors, make users sense that they are in a place in which they are not (i.e., the office, the doctor’s office, or a vacation resort). These sociotechnical systems represent a break from the mainstream. Along with the metaverse, other initiatives aimed at making up for the lack of immersive experience of traditional technologies for synchronous remote collaborations, such as Zoom, are surfacing. Examples include Apple’s augmented and mixed reality. While employing different devices, marketing approaches and strategies, they all represent sociotechnical systems aimed at overcoming the 2D limitations of current collaborative technologies. Yet, it remains to be seen whether they will actually be able to fill the gap between in-person and on-line interactions by providing immersive user experience. And, if so, at what cost?<br><br>Marabelli and Newell (2023), in a recent JSIS opinion paper, fleshed out several strategic opportunities and challenges of the future of on-line interactions, focusing on DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) issues, and on the metaverse. In this call for papers, we seek manuscripts that explore the future of work with respect to immersive platforms enabling innovative work practices and ask perspective authors specifically to consider the potential pitfalls (i.e., concerning ethics and DEI) of all this.<br><br>For instance, concerning remote working, on-line data on interactions are often harvested by analytics systems, as employee performance is assessed by automated systems such as AI. Such surveillance leaves certain segments susceptible to unfair assessment such as people with disabilities (who might not be able to access immersive platforms), women (notably less prone to speak up in on-line interactions ) and unfair treatment of non-White people (for instance, when technologies involve facial recognition systems to enter buildings and in accessing organizational resources). A further discriminatory factor concerns those excluded from remote work, such as some task workers (bus drivers, grocery store cashiers, carpenters, etc.) for whom it is impossible to perform their jobs remotely, and who often include disadvantaged people and people at the margin.<br><br>In healthcare, remotization might lead to unequal access to care, especially if telehealth becomes immersive, with remote patients required to wear devices (e.g., bodysuits) allowing clinicians to capture vitals. These devices are expensive and, for a long time, will not be available for everyone. For instance, it is foreseeable that in the US (a private/public healthcare system where private health is prevalent and very expensive), only people with private health insurance will be able to access immersive remote care. In addition, while telehealth is supposed to reach populations in rural areas and minimize travel for the elderly and people with limited mobility, remote immersive care requires broadband, which might be unavailable in these areas.<br><br>Higher education is prone to exclusions similar to those present in healthcare settings, with potential discriminations against financially weak students, students living in rural areas, students with disabilities etc. If the focus is shifted from students to professors, along with the aforementioned issues related to remote work, academics are and will be challenged by attending conferences in hybrid mode. On the one hand, expensive equipment to “attend” remotely using virtual reality may lead to the exclusion of people from under-represented regions and universities lacking resources for example. These issues will make it difficult to use hybrid techniques to include participants from the Global South (even though it might allow the participation of people who otherwise might not be able to travel, such as pregnant women). On the other hand, hybrid conferences might lead to a two-tier system of first and second class citizens, with the former enjoying social events after paper sessions, with the latter simply logging off (cf. Marabelli et al. 2023). In a debate on hybrid conferences, Ahuja (2023, Forthcoming), discusses the role of hybrid and on-line conferences in developing a sense of belonging (to the AIS community), as experienced by members of different regions. It is certainly possible that hybrid conferences intended to enhance diversity (allowing more participation from underrepresented regions for instance) end up being detrimental to inclusion. We thus invite theorizing on whether the constructs of diversity and inclusion should be decoupled in certain settings.<br><br>We have discussed remote work, healthcare and higher education as but three examples of the unequal impact that novel technologies, involving virtual, augmented and mixed reality, may involve. Other examples include the use of these technologies by law enforcement, which might collect user behavior data on such platforms and draw conclusions on what individuals could do in off-line settings – leading to predictive policing not based on data about crimes and neighborhoods but instead on inferences on behavioral data happening in virtual environments enabled by immersive platforms. We welcome papers discussing remotization – and its dark side – in the above mentioned settings and more.<br><br>Importantly, along with the problems associated with remotization, authors should be able to point to solutions that are strategic for companies. While it is an obligation for every company to uphold ethical standards, thereby preventing discrimination, promoting inclusion and fairness (i.e., DEI), often company ethical standards coincide with the requirements of the law. It is therefore strategic for companies (and organizations more generally) to use novel immersive platforms in a responsible manner, for ethical as well as compliance reasons. Laws and regulations on privacy (cf. GDPR in Europe and PIPL in China) and the use of algorithmic-based systems (cf. AI Act in Europe), demand strategic actions aimed at ensuring the respect of current laws, also considering the international breadth of these laws and the global competitive environment in which we live. To this end, papers specifically tackling subjects concerning coercive forces, under the umbrella of institutional theories, are very welcome.<br><br>Another important point to consider is that of the environmental impact associated with the intense use of virtual realities in various settings of the workplace. The need for computational capabilities and storage will require heavy use of electricity (and cooling systems), which will contribute to the global warming. Yet, global warming has uneven consequences across populations. For instance, India (nearly 18% of the world population), generates 3% of the world pollution but pays a high price because of global warming, with temperatures having risen to 110F in June and July 2022 (Williams 2022). These and other issues – and associated potential for theorizing – are summarized by Marabelli and Newell (2023). We look for papers that either build on these issues or go beyond, given the broad landscape of industries and settings that are and will be affected by remotization, with a particular focus on emerging technologies related to virtual, augmented, and mixed reality enabled by immersive platforms.<br><br>Overall, we welcome empirical, theoretical, review and perspective/position papers. While we are inclined to recommend that papers with empirical data are preferred, we understand that we are discussing a phenomenon in its becoming. Yet, papers with primary data or those that systematically analyze secondary data on organizations using novel technologies for remotization are strongly encouraged. JSIS, while specific in its focus on strategy and strategizing (cf. Gable 2020) is inclusive as to the use of methods of any kind. Qualitative, quantitative, archival/historical analyses, mixed method papers, and experiments are all welcome, as long as rigor leads the collection of data (if applicable) and its analysis. Importantly, conclusions, critical reflections and impacts should result. Strong theoretical contributions are required for empirical and theoretical papers. Perspective/position papers should also contribute to theory, by developing a research agenda, with implications for practice also being highlighted. We will give priority to empirical, theoretical and review submissions, and encourage authors planning to submit a perspective/position paper to contact us directly, prior to submitting their work.</p>\n<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-roman;\">\n<li>People analytics in organizations, leveraging virtual realities with a focus on privacy/discriminations</li>\n<li>The present and future of telehealth with the support of immersive platforms</li>\n<li>The present and future of higher education with the support of immersive platforms</li>\n<li>Predictive policing using behavioral data stemming from immersive platforms</li>\n<li>Immersive platforms and academic conferences (cf.

            "paragraphs": [
                "In this call for papers, we seek manuscripts that explore the future of work with respect to immersive platforms enabling innovative work practices and ask perspective authors specifically to consider the potential pitfalls (i.e., concerning ethics and DEI) of all this.",
                "In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the operations of most companies worldwide to move online. The education systems along with several other services for citizens, including public administration, healthcare etc. followed suit (Marabelli et al. 2021). In a sense, the COVID-19 pandemic served as an unintended natural experiment, testing the extent to which current technologies are able to support remote/virtual interactions via immersive platforms. At the same time, the pandemic also exposed limitations of these arrangements, setting the groundwork for novel ways (and technologies) to promote further such interactions in the future.",
                "Most knowledge workers were already used to working remotely, at least occasionally, working from home, in virtual teams and on-line communities. Engagement in on-line meetings for prolonged periods of time, and sometimes overnight, was a disruptive change that left knowledge workers longing for a return to more in-person interactions. In healthcare, telecare was seldom used before the pandemic. Yet, when regular in-person visits became impossible, the industry adapted to the new realities and, as an example, in the US in 2021, telehealth services had been used 38 times more often than before the start of the pandemic (Marr 2022). Since then, most in-person healthcare operations have resumed. Similarly in the education sector, primary and secondary schools resumed in-person classes in most countries (China being a partial exception), as vaccines became available, and the effects of the pandemic faded. Higher education institutions, however, behaved differently. The already diffused offering of remote classes and curricula saw the pandemic as an opportunity to consolidate the on-line education industry, a development that is most likely here to stay (Lockee 2021). Looking at higher education from a researcher perspective, on-line meetings are certainly more common in the aftermath of the pandemic, along with conferences and workshops often being run in hybrid mode, albeit with mixed results (Marabelli et al. 2023).",
                "In sum, COVID-19 forced several industries to systematically adopt technologies and practices to work, interact and collaborate remotely. The pandemic also gave high-tech companies the push to develop new systems supporting on-line interactions in a supposedly more effective fashion. For instance, Meta, in 2021, had already invested over $10B in metaverse-related projects (Brown 2021). In January 2022, Microsoft invested $68.7B in the metaverse by acquiring Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a gaming and virtual reality company (Microsoft 2022). According to Matthew Ball’s (2021) definition, the metaverse is “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.” The metaverse is different from other collaborative platforms because of its immersiveness, meaning that the 3D technical features, along with the use of avatars and devices such as headsets and other types of sensors, make users sense that they are in a place in which they are not (i.e., the office, the doctor’s office, or a vacation resort). These sociotechnical systems represent a break from the mainstream. Along with the metaverse, other initiatives aimed at making up for the lack of immersive experience of traditional technologies for synchronous remote collaborations, such as Zoom, are surfacing. Examples include Apple’s augmented and mixed reality. While employing different devices, marketing approaches and strategies, they all represent sociotechnical systems aimed at overcoming the 2D limitations of current collaborative technologies. Yet, it remains to be seen whether they will actually be able to fill the gap between in-person and on-line interactions by providing immersive user experience. And, if so, at what cost?",
                "Marabelli and Newell (2023), in a recent JSIS opinion paper, fleshed out several strategic opportunities and challenges of the future of on-line interactions, focusing on DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) issues, and on the metaverse. In this call for papers, we seek manuscripts that explore the future of work with respect to immersive platforms enabling innovative work practices and ask perspective authors specifically to consider the potential pitfalls (i.e., concerning ethics and DEI) of all this.",
                "For instance, concerning remote working, on-line data on interactions are often harvested by analytics systems, as employee performance is assessed by automated systems such as AI. Such surveillance leaves certain segments susceptible to unfair assessment such as people with disabilities (who might not be able to access immersive platforms), women (notably less prone to speak up in on-line interactions ) and unfair treatment of non-White people (for instance, when technologies involve facial recognition systems to enter buildings and in accessing organizational resources). A further discriminatory factor concerns those excluded from remote work, such as some task workers (bus drivers, grocery store cashiers, carpenters, etc.) for whom it is impossible to perform their jobs remotely, and who often include disadvantaged people and people at the margin.",
                "In healthcare, remotization might lead to unequal access to care, especially if telehealth becomes immersive, with remote patients required to wear devices (e.g., bodysuits) allowing clinicians to capture vitals. These devices are expensive and, for a long time, will not be available for everyone. For instance, it is foreseeable that in the US (a private/public healthcare system where private health is prevalent and very expensive), only people with private health insurance will be able to access immersive remote care. In addition, while telehealth is supposed to reach populations in rural areas and minimize travel for the elderly and people with limited mobility, remote immersive care requires broadband, which might be unavailable in these areas.",
                "Higher education is prone to exclusions similar to those present in healthcare settings, with potential discriminations against financially weak students, students living in rural areas, students with disabilities etc. If the focus is shifted from students to professors, along with the aforementioned issues related to remote work, academics are and will be challenged by attending conferences in hybrid mode. On the one hand, expensive equipment to “attend” remotely using virtual reality may lead to the exclusion of people from under-represented regions and universities lacking resources for example. These issues will make it difficult to use hybrid techniques to include participants from the Global South (even though it might allow the participation of people who otherwise might not be able to travel, such as pregnant women). On the other hand, hybrid conferences might lead to a two-tier system of first and second class citizens, with the former enjoying social events after paper sessions, with the latter simply logging off (cf. Marabelli et al. 2023). In a debate on hybrid conferences, Ahuja (2023, Forthcoming), discusses the role of hybrid and on-line conferences in developing a sense of belonging (to the AIS community), as experienced by members of different regions. It is certainly possible that hybrid conferences intended to enhance diversity (allowing more participation from underrepresented regions for instance) end up being detrimental to inclusion. We thus invite theorizing on whether the constructs of diversity and inclusion should be decoupled in certain settings.",
                "We have discussed remote work, healthcare and higher education as but three examples of the unequal impact that novel technologies, involving virtual, augmented and mixed reality, may involve. Other examples include the use of these technologies by law enforcement, which might collect user behavior data on such platforms and draw conclusions on what individuals could do in off-line settings – leading to predictive policing not based on data about crimes and neighborhoods but instead on inferences on behavioral data happening in virtual environments enabled by immersive platforms. We welcome papers discussing remotization – and its dark side – in the above mentioned settings and more.",
                "Importantly, along with the problems associated with remotization, authors should be able to point to solutions that are strategic for companies. While it is an obligation for every company to uphold ethical standards, thereby preventing discrimination, promoting inclusion and fairness (i.e., DEI), often company ethical standards coincide with the requirements of the law. It is therefore strategic for companies (and organizations more generally) to use novel immersive platforms in a responsible manner, for ethical as well as compliance reasons. Laws and regulations on privacy (cf. GDPR in Europe and PIPL in China) and the use of algorithmic-based systems (cf. AI Act in Europe), demand strategic actions aimed at ensuring the respect of current laws, also considering the international breadth of these laws and the global competitive environment in which we live. To this end, papers specifically tackling subjects concerning coercive forces, under the umbrella of institutional theories, are very welcome.",
                "Another important point to consider is that of the environmental impact associated with the intense use of virtual realities in various settings of the workplace. The need for computational capabilities and storage will require heavy use of electricity (and cooling systems), which will contribute to the global warming. Yet, global warming has uneven consequences across populations. For instance, India (nearly 18% of the world population), generates 3% of the world pollution but pays a high price because of global warming, with temperatures having risen to 110F in June and July 2022 (Williams 2022). These and other issues – and associated potential for theorizing – are summarized by Marabelli and Newell (2023). We look for papers that either build on these issues or go beyond, given the broad landscape of industries and settings that are and will be affected by remotization, with a particular focus on emerging technologies related to virtual, augmented, and mixed reality enabled by immersive platforms.",
                "Overall, we welcome empirical, theoretical, review and perspective/position papers. While we are inclined to recommend that papers with empirical data are preferred, we understand that we are discussing a phenomenon in its becoming. Yet, papers with primary data or those that systematically analyze secondary data on organizations using novel technologies for remotization are strongly encouraged. JSIS, while specific in its focus on strategy and strategizing (cf. Gable 2020) is inclusive as to the use of methods of any kind. Qualitative, quantitative, archival/historical analyses, mixed method papers, and experiments are all welcome, as long as rigor leads the collection of data (if applicable) and its analysis. Importantly, conclusions, critical reflections and impacts should result. Strong theoretical contributions are required for empirical and theoretical papers. Perspective/position papers should also contribute to theory, by developing a research agenda, with implications for practice also being highlighted. We will give priority to empirical, theoretical and review submissions, and encourage authors planning to submit a perspective/position paper to contact us directly, prior to submitting their work."

As part of our commitment to continually improving our review processes at </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MIS Quarterly</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MISQ</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Lee, 1999; Saunders, 2005; Straub, 2008; Rai, 2016), this special issue aims to obtain evidence regarding the merits of a recent innovation in the review process—registered reports.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the registered report model is relatively new,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it has been adopted by over 200 journals across the sciences (Chambers, 2019). </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business and Information Systems Engineering </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was the first (and so far, lone) IS journal to adopt this model (Weinhardt et al., 2019). Other early adopters across the business fields include </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Journal of Accounting Research (JAR)</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Academy of Management Discoveries</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leadership Quarterly</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our goal in this special issue is to learn if the registered report model should be available as an ongoing model for </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MISQ</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as a supplement to our existing options. While we see a lot of promise in the model, we plan to test it first to learn if/how it can best suit our journal.</span></p>\n<p><strong>What is the Registered Report Model?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Figure 1 shows, the registered report model involves a 2-stage ‘acceptance’ process: a conditional acceptance </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data collection, followed by an acceptance if the authors follow the agreed plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to a normal review process, there are two main differences:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre/pilot data may (or may not) have been collected before conditional acceptance, but the main data will not have been collected prior to the conditional acceptance being offered</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The paper cannot be rejected due to its results.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://misq.umn.edu/media/.renditions/catalog/tmp/category/Screenshot_2022-12-22_at_12.09.49_PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"562\"></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please note that registered reports are not the same as ‘pre-registrations.’ Pre-registrations refer to the activity of registering one’s hypotheses (and other details) prior to testing them. Registered reports go a step further than pre-registrations in that the paper is submitted to the journal before the final data has even been collected.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Purported Benefits of the Registered Report Model</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early tests of the registered report model across the sciences are yielding positive results (Chambers &amp; Tzavella, 2022; Scheel et al., 2021; Soderberg et al., 2021), especially on the following dimensions: </span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Bias reduction:&nbsp;</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Registered reports were invented to overcome biases that can occur in review processes when editors/reviewers prefer to see results in a particular direction. For instance, editors/reviewers tend to reject papers with insignificant results, mixed results, or results that run counter to their desires. Registered reports facilitate the publication of such papers. Registered reports can also help reduce biases that affect authors because it frees authors from seeking results they may think they need to obtain to pass the review process.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Investment motivation:&nbsp;</em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It often takes substantial time and resources to collect an excellent data set. This can be risky if it may take multiple years to get a paper through the review process, only to get a late-round rejection. On the other hand, if you have received conditional acceptance on your paper <em>before</em> collecting the data, this transfers some of the risk from the authors to the editors. Authors are likely to be much more motivated to undertake the effort/time/cost to get the data if they know that their paper will not get rejected. This should increase our chances of getting higher-investment, higher-impact papers into <em>MISQ</em>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Review Criteria for the Special Issue</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Submissions to this special issue will be reviewed in a three-step process. Each step will focus on different criteria, which are outlined below:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1: Submission Proposals</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The senior editors will examine the submission to ensure it matches our criteria for suitability, which are:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the paper follow a hypothetico-deductive model of science?&nbsp; Does the paper seek to contribute by proposing predictions/hypotheses and testing them against empirical data?</span>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note:</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; Researchers may use the logical of hypothesis testing with many types of data (e.g., qualitative or quantitative, and primary or secondary data). The approach can also be used for many genres of IS research, including behavioral, organizational, design science, and economics.&nbsp; The use of hypothesis-testing also does not necessitate the use of null hypothesis significance testing, e.g., Bayesian methods of analysis can also be used.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the paper likely to benefit from a registered report model of peer-review compared to a regular peer-review process? In particular:&nbsp;</span>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bias reduction</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:&nbsp; Could the research potentially lead to results that contradict expectations and, thereby, trigger biases in a traditional review process (e.g., biases against controversial or null results)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investment motivation</span></em><strong>:&nbsp; </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could the research involve substantial investments (e.g., time/funds) that a traditional review process may disincentivise?&nbsp; That is, is it reasonable to assume that a research team may put greater effort into a risky empirical project if they have the review team’s support for the paper irrespective of the results?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Stage 1 Review (prior to final results)</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, the submission will be examined based on criteria for conditional (results-independent) acceptance:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the paper make hypotheses/predictions that, irrespective of the results, offer the potential for a significant contribution to research and practice?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the paper propose a research design and analytical approach that, if followed, would allow the purported hypotheses/predictions to be tested with an acceptable degree of rigor? &nbsp;<br></span><em>Note</em>: Some pre- or pilot-test results might be included at this stage, to show feasibility of the approach (e.g., for manipulation checks or power calculations), but they are not mandatory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Stage 2 Review (paper with results)</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the submission will be examined based on criteria for acceptance, which are:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did the paper implement the accepted research design and analytical approach? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the paper written to acceptance standards?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional analyses (optional)</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:&nbsp; While the realization of the results will not affect acceptance, it might result in requests for additional analysis from the editorial/review team to enhance the study’s contribution.&nbsp; Acceptance of the paper does not depend on the pattern of results reported – it only requires the authors to conduct and report the additional analyses.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Process and Timeline (subject to change)</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All submission proposals must be submitted via email via the proposal website: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_41wvfmPquoQ6MbY\">https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_41wvfmPquoQ6MbY</a> All papers moving forward to Stage 1 must then be submitted in the </span><strong>Special Issue category</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MISQ</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s ScholarOne submission site located at </span><a href=\"https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/misq\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/misq</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All submissions must adhere to MISQ submission instructions (see </span><a href=\"https://misq.org/instructions/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://misq.org/instructions/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), with a maximum length of 20 pages for proposals, 30 pages for Stage 1 submission (i.e., the length of an MISQ Research Note), and 55 pages for Stage 2 submissions (i.e., the length of an MISQ Research Article).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Optional Introductory Workshop</em></strong><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></em> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Registration due February 4, 2023; Workshop on February 20, 2023</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interested authors have the option to attend a workshop hosted by the Special Issue Senior Editors that will briefly describe the aims and process of the Special Issue, as well as answer any questions.&nbsp; To register, please sign up here: </span><a href=\"https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Do5qQbcLpoaXPw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Do5qQbcLpoaXPw</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Proposal Submission</em></strong><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></em> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due July 1, 2023</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As this Special Issue is offered to </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">test</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the Registered Report model, the SEs aim to only consider the minimum number of submissions.

The submission will be screened, and if deemed ready, will be sent out for review focusing on the criteria in Step 2. Submissions will receive a rejection, revision, or conditional acceptance at this stage. Multiple revisions may be required before a decision is rendered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: the final data is not collected at this stage. Instead, the research design and approach(es) for data collection and analysis must be described in enough detail to allow the review team to judge the expected contribution if the authors carried out the proposal plan.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Special Issue Workshop for Stage 1 Authors</em></strong><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></em> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early-Mid January 2024</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Special Issue workshop will be held to provide advice to authors of papers still progressing in the review process. Advice will focus on passing Stage 1 and key considerations to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Next Steps in the Review Process</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most Special Issues, papers move through (or exit) the review process at the same time. However, this is less practical with registered reports, as papers may receive differing decisions during Stage 1. Even though the papers will not necessarily move through the review process together, maximum times are set for each stage to facilitate our test of the Registered Report model.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To continue in the review process, a paper must reach conditional acceptance at Stage 1 within 1yr of first round submission (i.e., by Oct 1, 2024) and must be submitted for Stage 2 review within nine months after receiving a Stage 1 conditional acceptance. Nine months are offered (rather than the normal six months) to allow for higher-investment data collection. Authors will not be offered extensions beyond these time limits. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Special Issue Publication, Editorial, and Showcase Event</em></strong><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></em> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Be Determined</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the conclusion of the Special Issue, the Special Issue Editors will host a showcase event to promote the accepted papers and share learnings from the test, as well as describe if/how the model will be incorporated at </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MISQ</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the future.

Is it a 2-round review process?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. Multiple rounds may occur at each stage of the review process. We do not constrain the process to any number of revisions, just as we do not constrain the number of revisions in the normal review process. Editors will limit the number of revisions to the extent possible/reasonable. Experience at other journals suggest that, compared to a normal review process, the Stage 1 review process could be more intensive than normal because the review team needs assurance that the research design and analytical approach will offer a sufficient contribution. The payoff for extra work at the front-end is that the Stage 2 review should be faster.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Can all papers using a hypothesis-testing approach at MISQ request to use the registered report model of peer review rather than using the traditional review process?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please see the criteria for suitability. We do not envisage that all hypothesis-testing papers will be suitable for the registered report model. Rather, they are most suitable when they are associated with the criteria of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bias reduction</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">investment motivation</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>As an author, what prevents me from “gaming” the system (e.g., by collecting the data beforehand and submitting the research as if I did not know the results)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Stage 1 process can include several rounds during where you may be asked to change your data collection and/or analysis strategy. As a result, relying on pre-collected and pre-analysed data would be unlikely to succeed. Such attempts to “game” the review process would also breach publication ethics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Does the focus on hypothesis testing research mean that no exploratory analysis is possible in these papers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. Exploratory analyses could be highly applicable in papers submitted to the registered report review process. While exploratory research is not a required element of hypothesis-testing research, it can complement it (e.g., by clarifying the boundaries within which the hypotheses are supported/refuted). While the relevance of exploratory analyses will depend on the specific paper, such analyses could be a consideration during both stages of the review process. In Stage 1, the authors may propose (and the review team may assess and suggest revisions to) a set of exploratory analyses. In Stage 2, the review team may request additional analyses to enhance the paper’s contribution, and the authors may propose additional analyses in consultation with the Senior Editors (also see next question).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>After the Stage 1 review process, is the process absolutely rigid so that authors and editors cannot deviate from the agreed process at all?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. We propose to balance strictness with some flexibility, following recommendations from the earlier test at <em>JAR</em>. They found it helped to use a model that still demanded detailed transparency about what the authors planned to do; then, instead of an unconditional promise of acceptance (i.e., the paper is accepted at Stage 2 if the Stage 1 plan is followed), it’s a weaker promise of <em>result-independent acceptance</em>. This allows authors and editors to instigate changes based on the results; the paper <em>cannot be rejected</em> at Stage 2, if the authors conduct the tests outlined in Stage 1. The authors may decide to conduct additional tests in Stage 2 beyond those specified in Stage 1 while the Special Issue Senior Editors may also place conditions on Stage 2 acceptance regarding additional tests. In the latter case, it is only the <em>conduct</em> of the additional analyses that is required for acceptance, not a particular pattern of results. At JAR, they referred to this process as balancing flexibility and brittleness in planned analyses (Bloomfield et al., 2018), which is a balance that we see as valuable, too.</span></p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><strong>References&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bloomfield, R., Rennekamp, K., &amp; Steenhoven, B.

                "An irony of science is that, despite our devotion to evidence, there is little evidence underpinning many aspects of the journal review process (Linkov et al., 2006; Tennant & Ross-Hellauer 2020). As part of our commitment to continually improving our review processes at MIS Quarterly (MISQ) (Lee, 1999; Saunders, 2005; Straub, 2008; Rai, 2016), this special issue aims to obtain evidence regarding the merits of a recent innovation in the review process—registered reports.",
                "While the registered report model is relatively new, it has been adopted by over 200 journals across the sciences (Chambers, 2019). Business and Information Systems Engineering was the first (and so far, lone) IS journal to adopt this model (Weinhardt et al., 2019). Other early adopters across the business fields include Journal of Accounting Research (JAR), Academy of Management Discoveries, and Leadership Quarterly.",
                "Our goal in this special issue is to learn if the registered report model should be available as an ongoing model for MISQ, as a supplement to our existing options. While we see a lot of promise in the model, we plan to test it first to learn if/how it can best suit our journal.",
                "As Figure 1 shows, the registered report model involves a 2-stage ‘acceptance’ process: a conditional acceptance before data collection, followed by an acceptance if the authors follow the agreed plan.",
                "Compared to a normal review process, there are two main differences: Pre/pilot data may (or may not) have been collected before conditional acceptance, but the main data will not have been collected prior to the conditional acceptance being offered. The paper cannot be rejected due to its results.",
                "Please note that registered reports are not the same as ‘pre-registrations.’ Pre-registrations refer to the activity of registering one’s hypotheses (and other details) prior to testing them. Registered reports go a step further than pre-registrations in that the paper is submitted to the journal before the final data has even been collected.",
                "Early tests of the registered report model across the sciences are yielding positive results (Chambers & Tzavella, 2022; Scheel et al., 2021; Soderberg et al., 2021), especially on the following dimensions: Bias reduction: Registered reports were invented to overcome biases that can occur in review processes when editors/reviewers prefer to see results in a particular direction. For instance, editors/reviewers tend to reject papers with insignificant results, mixed results, or results that run counter to their desires. Registered reports facilitate the publication of such papers. Registered reports can also help reduce biases that affect authors because it frees authors from seeking results they may think they need to obtain to pass the review process. Investment motivation: It often takes substantial time and resources to collect an excellent data set. This can be risky if it may take multiple years to get a paper through the review process, only to get a late-round rejection. On the other hand, if you have received conditional acceptance on your paper before collecting the data, this transfers some of the risk from the authors to the editors. Authors are likely to be much more motivated to undertake the effort/time/cost to get the data if they know that their paper will not get rejected. This should increase our chances of getting higher-investment, higher-impact papers into MISQ. Submissions to this special issue will be reviewed in a three-step process. Each step will focus on different criteria, which are outlined below: Step 1: Submission Proposals The senior editors will examine the submission to ensure it matches our criteria for suitability, which are: Does the paper follow a hypothetico-deductive model of science? Does the paper seek to contribute by proposing predictions/hypotheses and testing them against empirical data? Note: Researchers may use the logical of hypothesis testing with many types of data (e.g., qualitative or quantitative, and primary or secondary data). The approach can also be used for many genres of IS research, including behavioral, organizational, design science, and economics. The use of hypothesis-testing also does not necessitate the use of null hypothesis significance testing, e.g., Bayesian methods of analysis can also be used. Is the paper likely to benefit from a registered report model of peer-review compared to a regular peer-review process? In particular: Bias reduction: Could the research potentially lead to results that contradict expectations and, thereby, trigger biases in a traditional review process (e.g., biases against controversial or null results)? Investment motivation: Could the research involve substantial investments (e.g., time/funds) that a traditional review process may disincentivise? That is, is it reasonable to assume that a research team may put greater effort into a risky empirical project if they have the review team’s support for the paper irrespective of the results? Step 2: Stage 1 Review (prior to final results) Next, the submission will be examined based on criteria for conditional (results-independent) acceptance: Does the paper make hypotheses/predictions that, irrespective of the results, offer the potential for a significant contribution to research and practice? Does the paper propose a research design and analytical approach that, if followed, would allow the purported hypotheses/predictions to be tested with an acceptable degree of rigor? Note: Some pre- or pilot-test results might be included at this stage, to show feasibility of the approach (e.g., for manipulation checks or power calculations), but they are not mandatory. Step 3: Stage 2 Review (paper with results) Lastly, the submission will be examined based on criteria for acceptance, which are: Did the paper implement the accepted research design and analytical approach? Is the paper written to acceptance standards? Additional analyses (optional): While the realization of the results will not affect acceptance, it might result in requests for additional analysis from the editorial/review team to enhance the study’s contribution. Acceptance of the paper does not depend on the pattern of results reported – it only requires the authors to conduct and report the additional analyses. All submission proposals must be submitted via email via the proposal website: https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_41wvfmPquoQ6MbY. All papers moving forward to Stage 1 must then be submitted in the Special Issue category through MISQ’s ScholarOne submission site located at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/misq. As this Special Issue is offered to test the Registered Report model, the SEs aim to only consider the minimum number of submissions. Accordingly, the team seeks 20-30 proposal submissions in total. Proposals must be submitted to the Special Issue SEs at https://umn.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_41wvfmPquoQ6MbY by July 1, 2023. The proposals should briefly outline the paper’s motivation, background, theory/hypotheses, method, and expected contribution to the field. Proposals must address the criteria outlined in Step 1. Proposals will be screened by the Special Issue Senior Editor and up to one (1) guest Associate Editor from the current MISQ Editorial Board based on topic, theory, and method expertise. The Special Issue Senior Editors will seek to identify up to 30 papers with the remaining papers desk rejected. Papers receiving a desk rejection will only receive high-level feedback based on lack of fit with the Special Issue goals. Authors of papers moving to the next stage in the process will receive feedback on how to strengthen the paper prior to submitting through MISQ’s ScholarOne submission site. Papers moving to this stage should provide a refined version of the material in the proposal and be a maximum length of 30 pages. Each submission will be assigned to two (2) Special Issue Senior Editors based on topic, theory, and method fit. The submission will be screened, and if deemed ready, will be sent out for review focusing on the criteria in Step 2. Submissions will receive a rejection, revision, or conditional acceptance at this stage. Multiple revisions may be required before a decision is rendered. Remember: the final data is not collected at this stage. Instead, the research design and approach(es) for data collection and analysis must be described in enough detail to allow the review team to judge the expected contribution if the authors carried out the proposal plan. At the conclusion of the Special Issue, the Special Issue Editors will host a showcase event to promote the accepted papers and share learnings from the test, as well as describe if/how the model will be incorporated at MISQ in the future. They will also write an editorial on the process and key lessons learned."

Indeed, ever since reserved frequencies were gifted to television broadcasters in the 1950s, on the condition that they inform the public of current events, the subsidy underpinning newspapers and other forms of institutional media has slowly eroded. Like many other industries, the internet has accelerated this phenomenon. Not only has the hyper-targeted advertising facilitated by social media and other platforms functionally eroded the subsidy model to its breaking point (Anderson et al., 2015; Angelucci &amp; Cagé, 2019; Gentzkow, 2014; Seamans &amp; Zhu, 2013); but the costless transmission of data facilitated by the internet has increased geographic scope of dominant players (e.g. The New York Times), permitting them to reach beyond their original markets and squeeze content producers across the globe (Brock, 2013; George &amp; Waldfogel, 2006). Against this backdrop, it is hard to overstate the importance of this “crisis of the institutional press” (Reese, 2020). The news provides our primary means for understanding the world around us. Societies desperately need a well-functioning institutional press to tackle the many societal, economic, and environmental challenges we all face. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first day of core MIS undergraduate or MS/MBA classes usually begins with one of four motivating examples: the decline of incumbent sellers (e.g. Blockbuster Video, malls, taxis) in favor of digital platforms (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, Uber), the increasing irrelevance of diseconomies of scale and the rise of digital monopolies (e.g. Google, Microsoft), the rise of social media and user generated content (viz. Web 2.0 and 3.0), or the decline of the newspaper industry. Yet, as these classes continue to discuss the opportunities firms have in the digital age (seamlessly changing prices, directly engaging with consumers via social media), and teach students to implement advanced analytics to more effectively mine business value from data, the decline of institutional media often fades into the background.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This phenomenon-driven special issue is motivated by the view that our students, colleagues, and society urgently need a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the changing nature of news in the digital era and potential solutions going forward. The special issue takes an interdisciplinary perspective, bringing together insights from across the broader information, managerial, and organizational sciences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This failure to discuss the implications of the decline of institutional news media is troubling. Not only has the Fourth Estate historically served to counterbalance institutions with a monopoly on force and morality (e.g., the state and church), it has been a cornerstone of democratic republics for centuries. In 17th Century England, the philosopher John Locke railed against the Licensing and Press Act of 1662, claiming that “gagging a man, for fear he should talk heresy or sedition, has no other ground than such as will make chains necessary.” In the United States, James Madison declared the free press as “the only effectual guardian of every other right.” In the balance, Western Marxists criticized the singular power of institutional media, seeing it as an instrument for ideological control (Marcuse, 1964).</p>\n<p>These claims are not idle musings. News media outlets have been shown to influence many societal outcomes, from government agendas (Edwards &amp; Wood, 1999; Walgrave et al., 2008), to public opinion (Gamson &amp; Modigliani, 1989), to voting behavior (Druckman, 2005). The Fourth Estate mediates the attention granted to social movements (Andrews &amp; Caren, 2010) and can influence the strategic management of organizations (Bednar, 2012; Bednar et al., 2013). Institutional media can also prompt changes in corporate governance (Dyck et al., 2008): it can shape the valuation of firms at IPO (Pollock et al., 2008), influence firm founding (Greenwood &amp; Gopal, 2015), confer legitimacy on industries (Zilber, 2006), and even elevate de novo technological innovations in the public consciousness (Miranda et al., 2022; Wang &amp; Swanson, 2008).</p>\n<p>Yet, seismic changes have assaulted the free press as we understand it. The late 20th century witnessed an increasing concentration in ownership of news outlets, leading to elevated reliance on advertising revenue that biased content (Gilens &amp; Hertzman, 2000; Herman &amp; Chomsky, 1988; Lazarsfeld &amp; Merton, 2000). The recent history of the institutional press is interwoven with the history of digital technology. Initially, the World Wide Web served largely as a vehicle for the dissemination of news produced by professional news organizations, extending their reach (George &amp; Waldfogel, 2006; Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996). In time, the ensuing competition for reader attention shifted the gatekeeping function previously served by professional news organizations to portals – or online content curators (Hargittai, 2000). Contemporary media coverage became more selective (Oliver &amp; Maney, 2000) and influenced by market actors (Ahern &amp; Sosyura, 2014; Bail, 2012). With the advent of social media, user-generated content further usurped the gatekeeping role of professional news organizations, specifically that of their journalists whose work was governed by professional norms and practices (Reese, 2020). Moreover, public subsidy for the Fourth Estate was undermined by social media (Seamans &amp; Zhu, 2014), accelerating the control of dominant players like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on public discourse (George &amp; Waldfogel, 2006). In turn, this hollowed the local publishing industry, subverting attention to local political issues (i.e. nationalizing politics (Trussler, 2021)) and increasing economic agents’ willingness to contravene state and federal law (Matherly &amp; Greenwood, 2022). At the same time, social media has afforded citizen journalists the ability to counter-balance the biases of professional news organizations. For example, the interests of the populace were pitted against those of media organizations with the legislative proposal of the Stop Online Piracy bill (Miranda et al., 2016).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even more recently, society has witnessed a demonstrable shift towards the “post-truth era,” in which populist, tribalist, and anti- “mainstream media” rhetoric proliferates. Indeed, scholarship suggests that such rhetoric serves to further undermine public confidence in the institutional press, pushing large portions of the populace towards alternate media that eschew journalistic norms and evidence-based reporting (Reese, 2020). While the blockchain has been heralded as a way of remaking the institutional press in the digital era (Ivancsics, 2019), we have little systematic understanding of its efficacy. All the while, the process of news construction and dissemination is being disrupted by algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (Diakopoulos, 2019). The long-term implications of these AI tools (e.g., Reuters’ Lynx Insights) on the institutional press are unknown (Kobie, 2018). Indeed, we are witnessing intersections of the evolutionary paths of technology and the institutional press in ways that are &nbsp;fundamentally changing the “freedom of the press” and the complex network that includes journalists, software engineers, relational databases, and social media platforms which form it; along with prevailing norms, values, and institutional logics of a particular sociotechnical moment (Ananny, 2018).</p>\n<p>Research has only begun to address these changes. A cursory evaluation of premiere information systems and management outlets reveals a dearth of research which directly engages with the changing nature of the institutional press (Aral &amp; Dhillon, 2021; Clemons et al., 2002; Greenwood &amp; Gopal, 2015; Kitchens et al., 2020; Seamans &amp; Zhu, 2014; Venkatesan et al., 2021). The purpose of this Special Issue is to address this gap in scholarship head on and to inform stakeholders such as media managers, social planners, legislators, trade associations, regulators, and journalists about how changes in institutional media are affecting society at the intersection of business, technology, and public policy. To this end, we invite scholarship that helps academia and society (1) comprehend the major changes taking place within the institutional press, why those changes are occurring, and what the consequences of those changes are; and (2) work together toward a more positive future for the institutional press.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Few problems of today epitomize the intersection of the technological and the institutional (Barley &amp; Orlikowski, 2023) as the modern day Fourth Estate. To encourage the necessary scholarship on the challenges and opportunities facing it, we have assembled an interdisciplinary research team of scholars across diverse theoretical and methodological paradigms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We encourage an equally diverse breadth of scholars to submit their work to this special issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Potential Topics</h2>\n<p>The fundamental challenge that spurred this Special Issue is, “How do we reimagine the institutional press in the Digital Era?” More aspiringly, “How can scholars turn these challenges into opportunities for society as a whole?”</p>\n<p>Potential topics for this Special Issue include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The changing nature of the press, news media as an institution, and the consequences of those changes. Topics include, re-envisioning the “institutional” nature of the evolving institutional press; spillovers from: the changing nature of governance, digital threats and / or violence against journalists, the decline of local news, the endangering of the local watchdog, and online / offline credibility; as well as strategic consequences including changing content, pricing, promotion, platform, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The functioning of, and implications for, non-traditional digital era news sources. A non-exhaustive list includes advocacy (e.g., Ushahidi) or investigation networks (e.g., the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists), investment research firms (e.g., Hindenburg), emergent digital news organizations (e.g., ProPublica), and others that produce data to inform the news.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What constitutes news in the digital era? Topics include content characteristics, (i.e., genres such as world news, politics, economy, tech, lifestyle/entertainment); temporal and spatial characteristics of the production and dissemination of news; and psychological reactions, (i.e., behaviors and emotions relating to media sensationalism, increasing personalization, and the identifiable bias of media).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The interaction of social and institutional media. Topics include social media platforms and practices that legitimatize or delegitimatize institutional media; partnerships between legacy and de novo media producers; political institutions and the press (e.g. Fairness and Mayflower doctrines); the (de)institutionalizing role of humor and satire; and the consequences of generative AI use for the institutional press.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The role of professional standards and gatekeeping in today’s news media ecosystem and mechanisms to support them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sociotechnical approaches to understanding the intersections and dependencies between technologies, institutional forces, values, and norms in relation to freedom of the press as both a practical and ideological institution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Designing and assessing IT artifacts (e.g., generative AI, algorithms and computational methods, blockchain) towards an aspirational institutional press that promotes journalistic norms and reclaims the role of media as a guardian of other socio-economic institutions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The news as a dynamic construct across time and space, and the consequent implications for content generation and consumption.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The news as a societal information system. What are the design guidelines or best practices for such a societal information system that supports news creation processes as a social construction? Can/should we consider the news as an algorithmic artifact with less human-in-the-loop – as an engagement/revenue optimization-oriented algorithmic construction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In exploring these topics, we urge submitters to foreground the institutional press in their analyses, considering the implications of the changing nature of the institutional press through digitization, the changing relationship between the institutional press and economic institutions, the role institutional media plays as a watchdog for society at large (e.g., the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists uncovering of the Panama and Paradise Papers, WikiLeaks, citizen journalism), and jurisdictional differences across the globe (i.e., China, The United States, Europe).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We discourage submissions on topics as well. The primary reasons for this discouragement are that these topics have either (1) already received significant attention or (2) do not foreground the institutional press. These include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>algorithmic detection and the management of fake news</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>social media echo chambers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>experiments assessing the efficacy of generative AI in advertising</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If in doubt about the suitability of your research to the special issue, please connect with the editors. We also encourage participation in the information workshop at the 2024 Academy of Management Annual Meeting in Chicago (and subsequent online workshops).&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Process and Timeline (subject to change)</h2>\n<p>All papers must be submitted in the Special Issue category through MISQ’s ScholarOne submission site located at https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/misq except for the extended abstracts. The optional extended abstracts must be submitted via email to MISQ.SI.Fourth.Estate@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>All submissions must adhere to MISQ submission instructions (see https://misq.umn.edu/instructions/).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Optional Two-page Abstract Submission: Due April 30, 2024&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Authors are strongly encouraged to submit abstracts for editors to evaluate fit for the special issue. Submit extended abstracts at MISQ.SI.Fourth.Estate@gmail.com. Editors will offer feedback on abstracts by May 30, 2024, encouraging authors of promising abstracts to submit a five-page extended abstract for workshops at AOM in August of 2024. These five-page extended abstracts will not be formally reviewed prior to the workshop – they are simply meant to facilitate a constructive discussion at the event. The five-page extended abstracts will only be shared with the guest SEs and AEs. At the workshop, participants will have time to present their research to workshop attendees. Note that author teams not invited to attend the workshop may still submit a full paper to MISQ by December 1 deadline.</p>\n<h3>Full Paper Submission: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Due December 1, 2024</h3>\n<p>ScholarOne will be open for submissions to the special issue from November 1, 2024, to December 1, 2024. No extensions for the timeline will be granted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The editorial team will screen all submitted manuscripts. Only manuscripts deemed to have a reasonable chance of acceptance in an accelerated review process will remain under consideration. Manuscripts that pass the initial screening will undergo no more than three rounds of review. Manuscripts not accepted by the end of the third round will be rejected. The Senior Editors will make the final decisions based on the Associate Editor report and review feedback.</p>\n<p>Authors must adhere to a strict schedule for submission and revision of manuscripts. Authors may submit rejected papers as regular submissions to MIS Quarterly only if the special issue rejection letter recommends such an action. The Senior Editors will recommend submission as a regular MISQ article only in special circumstances, such as when a formally reviewed manuscript had a strong likelihood of acceptance but either was deemed to be a poor fit with the theme of the special issue or required revisions that were unlikely to be accomplished within the special issue’s accelerated review schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Revision Plan Meeting: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Summer 2025</h3>\n<p>Authors of papers that go past the first round must commit to attending a virtual meeting with the special issue editors to discuss revision plans in early summer of 2025.</p>\n<h3>Key Dates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Optional abstract submission due: April 30, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optional abstract feedback via email: May 30, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Invited five-page abstract for AOM Workshop due: August 5, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper Development Workshop at AOM: August 9-17, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>First-round submissions due: December 1, 2024</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>First-round decisions expected: March 15, 2025</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Revision Plan Meeting with SI Editors: May 30, 2025 (tentatively)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second-round revisions due: July 15, 2025</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second-round decisions expected: October 15, 2025</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third- and final revisions submissions due: February 15, 2026</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Final decisions expected: May 15, 2026</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Associate Editors (alphabetical order)</h4>\n<p>Manuscripts submitted to the special issue will be assigned to a suitable Associate Editor, chosen from among the existing MISQ Editorial Board or from the additional special issue Associate Editors listed below.</p>\n<p>Mike Annay, University of Southern California, USA<br>Jens Foerderer, Technische Universität München, Germany&nbsp;<br>Anand Gopal, National Technical University of Singapore, Singapore<br>Brent Kitchens, University of Virigina, USA<br>Gene Moo Lee, UBC Sauder School of Business, Canada<br>Attila Marton, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark<br>Jeffrey Nickerson, Stevens Institute of Technology, USA<br>Christopher Parker, American University, USA<br>Caitlin Petre, Rutgers University, USA<br>Christian Peukert, HEC Lausanne, Switzerland<br>Aleš Popovič, NEOMA Business School, France<br>Jui Ramaprasad, University of Maryland, USA<br>Imke Reimers, Cornell University, USA<br>Jie Ren, Fordham University, USA<br>Gaurav Sabnis, Stevens Institute of Technology, USA<br>Ananya Sen, Carnegie Mellon University, USA<br>Jananki Srinivasan, IIIT-Bangalore, India<br>Xiao Xiao, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark<br>Yi Yang, HKUST, Hong Kong<br>Nan Zhang, University of Florida, USA<br>Aljona Zorina, IESEG, France</p>\n<h4>References&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>Ahern, K.

                "Over the last 20 years, ongoing waves of digitalization have decimated the traditional business model of the news and fundamentally changed how the news, or more formally, the ‘institutional press’, works. Indeed, ever since reserved frequencies were gifted to television broadcasters in the 1950s, on the condition that they inform the public of current events, the subsidy underpinning newspapers and other forms of institutional media has slowly eroded. Like many other industries, the internet has accelerated this phenomenon. Not only has the hyper-targeted advertising facilitated by social media and other platforms functionally eroded the subsidy model to its breaking point; but the costless transmission of data facilitated by the internet has increased geographic scope of dominant players permitting them to reach beyond their original markets and squeeze content producers across the globe. Against this backdrop, it is hard to overstate the importance of this “crisis of the institutional press”. The news provides our primary means for understanding the world around us. Societies desperately need a well-functioning institutional press to tackle the many societal, economic, and environmental challenges we all face.",

The special issue takes an interdisciplinary perspective, bringing together insights from across the broader information, managerial, and organizational sciences.",

Many issues in information assurance have arisen in the last decade or two, including risk management, information quality, intellectual property, privacy protection, compliance with regulations, and continuity of operations (Mahmood et al., 2010; Forrest, 2023). As a result, protecting information has become a global priority, and collaborative efforts are being made to prevent, detect, and react to threats to information quality, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability (European Parliament, 2018; White House, 2023a). As society steps into the age of generative AI (GenAI) (Dennehy et. al., 2023), fresh challenges and opportunities are arising in the realms of information security, privacy, and quality. Questions have emerged regarding the role and intended/unintended consequences of GenAI in information assurance. GenAI is believed to pose a paradox, serving as a dual-edged sword in the realm of information assurance (Robidoux, 2024).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>GenAI creates new content, whereas traditional AI mostly makes predictions and classifications based on existing datasets. GenAI is designed to reason and operate independently across various domains, whereas traditional AI focuses on narrow tasks (e.g., playing chess and translating languages by following specific rules). In addition, GenAI works with multiple data modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos), whereas traditional AI primarily functions in a single mode of data. These new capabilities of GenAI open new possibilities for its applications in a wide range of areas. GenAI models can range from generalized models to domain-specific models that automate tasks and generate content adhering to industry-specific terminologies, context-specialized knowledge, and tailored experiences. Its power has sparked discussions on ethics and societal questions regarding the potential impact on employment, bias, privacy, and human-AI relationships.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The emergence of GenAI is poised to exert a profound impact on assurance (Barrett et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). On the one hand, GenAI has been recognized for its ability to bolster information assurance. The IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) commented that GenAI has the potential to strengthen business defenses, accelerate security processes, and identify emerging threats as they arise. Studies have also noted that GenAI may be able to address information management challenges, including quality (Bhatti, 2024). On the other hand, GenAI heightens the potency of existing threats, allows the fabrication of false information, fuels intellectual property theft, and poses challenges to governance and compliance. The 2024 February deepfake fraud incident in Hong Kong is a case in point (Chen &amp; Magramo, 2024). Even unexpected users can threaten the protection of data, which is manifested by examples of employees sharing confidential data with GenAI models. Industry reports from Forrester (2023), Cisco (2024), and the IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) have highlighted GenAI-induced risks to information assurance as a major threat to firms’ adoption and implementation of GenAI initiatives. Similar concerns have been acknowledged from a government perspective in the 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (White House, 2023b) and the 2023 congressional research report: Generative Artificial Intelligence and Data Privacy: A Primer (Congressional Research Service, 2023).</p>\n<p>Examples of how GenAI may exacerbate information assurance issues include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Sophisticated human-deception attacks:</strong> Cybercriminals can use GenAI to compromise businesses by writing targeted emails. In addition, GenAI can create deepfakes and voice clones, resulting in “vishing” that uses phone calls and voice messages to trick people into sharing sensitive information.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Hallucination and confabulation:</strong> GenAI is known to create incorrect information that is seemingly correct. In addition, attackers may trick GenAI into recommending unverified software code packages to unexpected users. When attackers embed malicious codes into packages endorsed by GenAI, users may unwittingly download and utilize these harmful codes, creating security vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Intellectual property theft: </strong>GenAI can create materials that violate intellectual property rights. For example, GenAI can create content that resembles existing copyrighted materials, resulting in legal ramifications and conflicts.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges in regulation and compliance:</strong> Keeping GenAI models in check is subject to considerable hurdles because of how intricate and swiftly they evolve. Ensuring compliance with data protection laws and standards will become increasingly difficult as GenAI becomes more autonomous and capable of making independent decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another source of threats to information assurance stems from attacks that are designed to target the way GenAI systems are trained and expected to be used. Many of these attacks can be mitigated by explicitly integrating information assurance considerations when designing GenAI systems. For example, GenAI tools may be subject to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unreliable training data: </strong>A substantial amount of training data is employed in constructing large language models (LLMs). Yet this data may be of low quality and is often unverified. The security of the models is influenced by the quality of the training data, paving the way for potential vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and compromises regarding sensitive information.</li>\n<li><strong>Data poisoning:</strong> GenAI needs to be trained and tuned on inputs and outputs. Data poisoning occurs when inputs are manipulated to alter or corrupt the training data in LLMs, which consequently impacts the desired outputs of the overall system.</li>\n<li><strong>Security leaks, inference attacks, and knowledge phishing:</strong> Security leaks in the context of GenAI refer to the unintended disclosure of sensitive information embedded within a model itself or through its responses. This is also known as inference attacks or knowledge phishing.</li>\n<li><strong>Prompt injections:</strong> Prompt injections occur when malicious inputs are provided to an AI system to manipulate its output or to execute unintended actions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cisco (2024) found that 92% of organizations “see GenAI as fundamentally different, requiring new techniques to manage data and risks.” The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls for actions on refining GenAI by mitigating information assurance issues (White House, 2023b). Worldwide efforts are being made on these fronts to protect LLMs against threats of information fabrication, system misuse, privacy breaches, etc. Gartner recommends mitigation strategies, which include “establishing a governance entity and workflow, monitoring and blocking access, communicating acceptable use policies, exploring prompt engineering and API integrations, and prioritizing private hosting options” (Robidoux, 2024). However, there are growing concerns that excessive focus and regulation on data security and privacy may stifle and slow the advancement of GenAI, especially in terms of the European Union’s AI Act (Timis, 2023).</p>\n<p>The relationship between GenAI and information assurance is depicted below.</p></div><figure data-content-type=\"image\" data-appearance=\"full-width\" data-element=\"main\" data-pb-style=\"Y1Y1CNR\"><img class=\"pagebuilder-mobile-hidden\" src=\"https://misq.umn.edu/media/wysiwyg/Picture1_AIIA.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-element=\"desktop_image\" data-pb-style=\"DYLF2OI\"><img class=\"pagebuilder-mobile-only\" src=\"https://misq.umn.edu/media/wysiwyg/Picture1_AIIA.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-element=\"mobile_image\" data-pb-style=\"B8KKJCB\"></figure><h4 data-content-type=\"heading\" data-appearance=\"default\" data-element=\"main\">Potential\nTopics</h4><div data-content-type=\"text\" data-appearance=\"default\" data-element=\"main\"><p>Tremendous new opportunities exist for information systems (IS) scholars to study information assurance issues within the context of GenAI, as traditional approaches may not work. The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (White House, 2023b) calls on academia to join forces with the government, the private sector, and civil society to create a society-wide effort. Likewise, the World Economic Forum (2023) calls for researchers to collaborate with AI developers, standard-setting bodies, and policymakers to develop an all-stakeholder approach. In sharp contrast to the substantial attention that the government and the private sectors have paid to security and privacy in relation to GenAI, IS research in this area is limited (Berente, et. al., 2021; Lee et al., 2023; Samtani et al., 2023).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Potential topics for this special issue include but are not limited to the following: What factors influence individuals’ security and privacy behavior in the presence of GenAI tools? How can we predict, analyze, and counteract the emerging threats to GenAI models? How can economic analysis contribute to combating information assurance threats in GenAI? What are the managerial strategies and their effectiveness in addressing GenAI-induced issues on data security and privacy? What are the key principles in attributing accountability and responsibilities for the risks in GenAI model output? In addition to these topics, submissions focusing on AI research related to addressing emerging information assurance issues are also encouraged for the special issue.</p>\n<p>Sample topics include (1) individual behaviors, (2) organizational practices, (3) societal impacts, (4) risk management, (5) investments in assurance, (6) market effects, and (7) attacker analysis (Hui et al., 2016; Hoehle et al., 2022). These topics align with MIS Quarterly’s goal of “moving beyond management and use of technology to also include societal and policy impacts” (Brown, 2024, p. i). This special issue seeks research that goes beyond simple applications of existing theories and methods from the cybersecurity literature in IS. We invite studies that explore the unique information assurance challenges in the realm of GenAI, calling for the development and application of new theories or methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By focusing on important research questions, this special issue will generate answers to address the NSF 10 Big Ideas (e.g., Future of Work and Harnessing the Data Revolution), NSF Focus Areas (e.g., Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity), National Academy of Engineering 14 Grand Challenges (e.g., Secure Cyberspace), and E.U. Strategies Priorities 2021-2027 (e.g., Cybersecurity). It also aligns with the national focus on exploring the intersection between AI and security (National Science Foundation, 2024). This special issue also connects with IS research streams, such as the Bright Internet. Finally, this special issue builds on the special issue by Mahmood et al. (2010) to address the new challenges posed by GenAI, including the bidirectional relationships between GenAI and information assurance.</p></div><h4 data-content-type=\"heading\" data-appearance=\"default\" data-element=\"main\">Projected Timeline and\nProcess</h4><div data-content-type=\"text\" data-appearance=\"default\" data-element=\"main\"><p><em>Timeline</em> (subject to change)</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody id=\"AADQWTT\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Optional introductory workshops (virtual): informational sessions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">November 15, 2024</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Two-page abstracts</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">January 20, 2025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Feedback on abstracts</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">March 31, 2025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Paper development workshop (virtual)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">May 10, 2025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">First-round paper submission</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">October 31, 2025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">First-round decisions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">January 31, 2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Workshop for authors with first-round revise-and-resubmit</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">February, 2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Second-round revisions due</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">May 31, 2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Second-round decisions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">August 31, 2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Final revisions due</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">November 30, 2026</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">Final revisions</td>\n<td style=\"width: 49.96%;\">February 28, 2027</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><div data-content-type=\"text\" data-appearance=\"default\" data-element=\"main\"><p><em>Process</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The special issue guest editors will organize optional virtual workshops to describe the aims and processes of this special issue and answer questions.

            "paragraphs": [
                "Digital threats continue to impede information assurance. Many issues in information assurance have arisen in the last decade or two, including risk management, information quality, intellectual property, privacy protection, compliance with regulations, and continuity of operations. As a result, protecting information has become a global priority, and collaborative efforts are being made to prevent, detect, and react to threats to information quality, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability. As society steps into the age of generative AI (GenAI), fresh challenges and opportunities are arising in the realms of information security, privacy, and quality. Questions have emerged regarding the role and intended/unintended consequences of GenAI in information assurance. GenAI is believed to pose a paradox, serving as a dual-edged sword in the realm of information assurance.",
                "GenAI creates new content, whereas traditional AI mostly makes predictions and classifications based on existing datasets. GenAI is designed to reason and operate independently across various domains, whereas traditional AI focuses on narrow tasks. In addition, GenAI works with multiple data modalities, whereas traditional AI primarily functions in a single mode of data. These new capabilities of GenAI open new possibilities for its applications in a wide range of areas. GenAI models can range from generalized models to domain-specific models that automate tasks and generate content adhering to industry-specific terminologies, context-specialized knowledge, and tailored experiences. Its power has sparked discussions on ethics and societal questions regarding the potential impact on employment, bias, privacy, and human-AI relationships.",
                "The emergence of GenAI is poised to exert a profound impact on assurance. On the one hand, GenAI has been recognized for its ability to bolster information assurance. It has the potential to strengthen business defenses, accelerate security processes, and identify emerging threats as they arise. Studies have also noted that GenAI may be able to address information management challenges, including quality. On the other hand, GenAI heightens the potency of existing threats, allows the fabrication of false information, fuels intellectual property theft, and poses challenges to governance and compliance.",
                "Examples of how GenAI may exacerbate information assurance issues include sophisticated human-deception attacks, hallucination and confabulation, intellectual property theft, and challenges in regulation and compliance. Another source of threats to information assurance stems from attacks that are designed to target how GenAI systems are trained and expected to be used. Many of these attacks can be mitigated by explicitly integrating information assurance considerations when designing GenAI systems.",
                "Cisco found that 92% of organizations “see GenAI as fundamentally different, requiring new techniques to manage data and risks.” The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls for actions on refining GenAI by mitigating information assurance issues. Worldwide efforts are being made on these fronts to protect LLMs against threats of information fabrication, system misuse, privacy breaches, etc., but there are growing concerns that excessive focus and regulation on data security and privacy may stifle and slow the advancement of GenAI.",
                "The relationship between GenAI and information assurance is depicted below. Tremendous new opportunities exist for information systems (IS) scholars to study information assurance issues within the context of GenAI, as traditional approaches may not work. The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls on academia to join forces with the government, the private sector, and civil society to create a society-wide effort. Likewise, the World Economic Forum calls for researchers to collaborate with AI developers, standard-setting bodies, and policymakers to develop an all-stakeholder approach.",
                "In sharp contrast to the substantial attention that the government and the private sectors have paid to security and privacy in relation to GenAI, IS research in this area is limited. This special issue seeks research that goes beyond simple applications of existing theories and methods from the cybersecurity literature in IS, inviting studies that explore the unique information assurance challenges in the realm of GenAI, calling for the development and application of new theories or methods."
