        "Since 2022, we have witnessed an inexorable flood of information about Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and its various components and manifestations. As hypes go, this one seems overdue for a cyclical correction; however, the enthusiasm for GAI across a wide range of contexts still rises. The euphoria permeates not just mainstream society and popular culture, but also business, politics, warfare and, of course, academia. The tone of inevitability about GAI and its benefits is fervent and the passion of many (notably academics, tech pundits and businesspeople) is abundant. This is not to say that there are no critical voices: there are, but their concerns risk being submerged by the tide of optimism and it may seem heretical to critique, let alone excoriate, the GAI phenomenon. For example, at some institutions, even measured critiques of GAI are viewed as misaligned with their forward-looking visions, creating an environment where scholars may feel pressured to conform to a predominantly positive narrative.",
        "Almost as soon as GAI was released and became a topic of discussion, we quickly saw a spate of opinions, accompanied by the wisdom of pundits and some speculative analyses of what the impact on a variety of societal and organizational functions might be. These early discussions lacked grounding in robust empirical or theoretical insights, instead reflecting speculative or overly generalized narratives. In many ways, these initial reactions paralleled the reactions to Artificial Intelligence almost forty years earlier (Sheil, 1987). Some academic publishers quickly outlawed the use of GAI by submitting authors and other notes of caution were expressed regarding the potential negative impacts. However, as the technology evolved, so in parallel did the restrictions on academic use, most of which were just as quickly retracted and replaced with more nuanced advisories. Academic institutions, journal publishers, and universities started to promulgate guidelines, essentially legitimizing GAI application, yet also unleashing peer and institutional pressure to take advantage of this new opportunity.",
        "In parallel to these academic perspectives, business organizations have expressed both enthusiasm for the technology and concerns about such issues as data protection, truth, trust, and errors, as well as how to train people to use GAI correctly. Today we see that AI-themed programmes and research centres are being created in profusion. This proliferation is worrisome not because of the exploration of GAI itself, but because it often lacks critical engagement with the potential harms and adverse consequences. At the ISJ, we have already seen both submissions and reviews where GAI appears to have played a role not so far from either co-author or some form of assistant. In response, we have published cautionary editorials (Davison et al., 2023, 2024). When it comes to AI-themed research submissions, our sense is that we are at the stage of the trickle before the deluge.",
        "Given the normative process of empirical (qualitative or quantitative) research, it is not surprising that few such AI-themed articles (e.g., Susarla et al., 2023; Grover, 2024) have been published. However, in a pre-GAI special issue (Mikalef et al., 2022), a more critical tone was adopted with an explicit focus on the dark side of AI. At the ISJ, the vast majority of GAI-themed submissions to date tend to emphasise the novelty of application area yet actually have little to do with IS and fail to engage with its broader sociotechnical axis. This reflects an ongoing challenge for IS scholars: how to meaningfully situate GAI research within the discipline's core concerns. Nevertheless, this also presents an opportunity for IS researchers to engage critically with GAI through theoretical and methodological innovation and empirical rigor.",
        "What we also find to be absent from much of the GAI-related work done so far is either a more critical stance or attempts to engage in rigorous and novel theoretical development on the impacts of GAI. This is troubling because of the risks that GAI poses to individuals, organizations, society more broadly, and the natural environment. In fact, poorly vetted applications of GAI run the risk of such negative outcomes as violating privacy, facilitating research misconduct, insulting customers, and discriminating unfairly against specific groups. Given this backdrop, we argue that the time is now ripe for researchers to critically investigate the diverse impacts of GAI. Analysing these impacts through a sociotechnical lens is essential to bridge the gap between technological advancements and their broader implications.",
        "We can expect that a wide variety of impacts may be experienced globally, some of which will be legal in one jurisdiction even as they are illegal elsewhere; this heightens concerns about widening digital and AI-related divides. To explain these phenomena and anticipate their future trajectories, researchers must employ appropriate theoretical frameworks and remain open to innovative forms of theorizing. GAI's emergence necessitates both the adaptation of existing theories and the development of new theoretical arguments that reflect its distinctive characteristics, such as its effects on human agency and the contextual nuances of its applications. We encourage the application of grounded research, given that GAI is still an emerging phenomenon. For example, theories of disruption, given the undeniably disruptive nature of GAI, may offer more fruitful opportunities for theoretical innovation, while critical design approaches rooted in theories of emancipation could illuminate issues of AI oppression.",
        "A robust theoretical foundation that explores the ‘dark side’ of GAI is indispensable for advancing sociotechnical research and addressing its complex, often adverse, societal impacts. In a positive sense, the research that we aim to publish in this special issue should contribute to our understanding of the potential negative impacts of GAI, with the hope that we can also mitigate them. In-depth ethnographic fieldwork, critical case studies, and grounded theory can help reveal and address the otherwise hidden aspects of GAI in practice. Action Researchers may go a step further to propose and even enact those mitigation strategies in particular contexts, thus subjecting their theoretical ideas to empirical tests. For this special issue, we specifically solicit research that draws on primary data. Primary data allows for a deeper understanding of GAI’s real-world impact and enables researchers to engage directly with stakeholders, such as individuals and organizations affected by GAI. We aim to foster research that is grounded in real-world experiences and produces theoretically innovative, methodologically rigorous work that can truly advance our understanding of GAI's sociotechnical consequences.",
        "We expect that authors will make a direct contribution to knowledge by developing a new theory or theorizations that acknowledge the unique characteristics of GAI. We welcome interdisciplinary work. We also welcome action research and design science studies if they empirically demonstrate how the negative impacts of GAI can be mitigated, and in addition develop theory. For this special issue, we do not accept the submission of stand-alone reviews of the technology, opinion papers and purely conceptual papers. Submissions to this special issue must align closely with the sociotechnical axis central to IS research. Specifically, we seek studies that explore the interplay between human, technological, environmental and organizational dimensions of GAI in real-world contexts. The range of topics and contexts that may be suitable is clearly extensive, and thus we only provide a partial list below. As we indicate above, we are particularly interested in the dark side of GAI."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Over the last years, platform partnerships between independent third-party developers (complementors) and providers of software platforms (platform owners) have become the prevailing model for developing and delivering software products and services. Platforms are strategic in enabling value co-creation through boundary resources—such as software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs)—which provide complementors with the tools needed to seamlessly integrate their offerings into the core platform infrastructure.",
        "Novel and creative uses of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), low-code/no-code platforms, and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) like blockchain are redefining how organizations interact, collaborate, and compete. AI and IoT enable real-time data analytics and predictive insights, allowing platforms to coordinate relationships and optimize sourcing decisions by anticipating demand, managing risks, and adjusting partnerships. IoT enhances this by providing continuous data streams from connected devices, enabling more responsive, data-driven collaborations in logistics and inventory management. Low-code/no-code platforms reduce entry barriers for participants, enabling organizations to develop solutions independently. Blockchain and smart contracts automate partnership agreements through self-executing code, reducing transaction costs and fostering trust, particularly in complex, cross-border environments.",
        "Together, these technologies have strategic implications on partnerships in platform ecosystems, potentially reshaping established practices in value co-creation and appropriation, and sourcing arrangements. While they offer complementors opportunities to innovate and gain leverage, they also equip platform owners with new tools to reinforce their dominance. Whether these new tools will benefit complementors or increase platform owners' control remains an open question. For example, as decentralized, real-time decision-making becomes more common, will these technologies empower complementors to innovate and operate autonomously, or will they reinforce existing power imbalances, allowing platform owners to strengthen centralized control and dictate terms of value appropriation and collaboration?",
        "As dominant platform owners like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in Western markets, and Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu in China, continue to control key sectors of consumer and business markets, complementors face growing challenges in navigating the advantages of platform participation against the risks of dependency and lock-in, both undermining complementor autonomy. Meanwhile, the evolving regulatory landscape, such as the European Union’s (EU) Digital Markets Act, seeks to address these power imbalances by imposing restrictions on platform gatekeepers that reshape partner strategies and value co-creation.",
        "Indeed, platform partnerships are undergoing significant strategic transformations. Advancements in technologies such as AI, IoT, and blockchain, along with shifts in political and regulatory environments, are influencing how partnerships within platform ecosystems evolve. In this rapidly changing landscape, critical questions arise about the future dynamics of partnerships in platform ecosystems. How will the balance between value co-creation and value appropriation shift as AI, DLT, and IoT become more integrated into platform partnerships? Will these technologies empower complementors to innovate and capture a fair share of the value they create, or will they enable platform owners to centralize control, deepening dependencies and shifting value appropriation in their favor? Ultimately, how can both platform owners and complementors strategically navigate these changes to ensure mutual benefit in an increasingly complex ecosystem?",
        "This call for papers invites research that explores how these strategic shifts are reshaping platform partnerships, including changes in the strategies and business models of platform owners and complementors, and the governance of these partnerships and ecosystems. We welcome empirical, conceptual, design, and simulation research. Any methodologies and theoretical perspectives are encouraged as long as they contribute to the theoretical understanding of platform partnerships, along with practical insights."

        "The use of information systems in the enterprise is the backbone of digital transformation and digital business, acting as the binding force between technological, managerial, and organizational innovations. The design and use of information systems in the enterprise evolve alongside technological advancements, shifting managerial strategies, and changing organisational forms and needs (Kotusev, 2019).",
        "“Enterprise information systems” has been the key term for information systems that transcend narrow functions, processes, products, markets, or concerns (e.g., ERP, SCM, CRM) and integrate these elements, supporting end-to-end, creating synergy, and ensuring coherence in the enterprise context (Cao et al., 2022; Robey et al., 2002). Given the rapid pace of change and advancements in emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, edge computing), alternative approaches to information systems used in enterprises (e.g., shadow IT, cloud/as-a-service), and structures beyond single enterprises (e.g., platforms, ecosystems), this special issue is focused on the future of information systems in the enterprise context and deliberately uses this broader term to emphasise our interest in both conventional enterprise information systems and alternative IS/IT solutions used for similar enterprise-level issues.",
        "Information systems in the enterprise have undergone fundamental paradigm shifts in the past four decades. First, the integration scope of such systems has expanded to include customer activities, supply chains, and business ecosystems (Ignatiadis & Nandhakumar, 2007; Sambhara et al., 2022). Second, technological innovations have fundamentally changed the characteristics and positioning of information systems in the enterprise. These innovations include, among others, transitioning from on-premises to cloud-based operations, shifting from traditional license to as-a-service models, incorporating analytic and execution functionalities, integrating with or evolving into digital platforms, adopting edge computing, and adding artificial intelligence functionalities (Dong et al., 2009; Flak et al., 2022).",
        "These developments set the stage for future challenges, such as how enterprises will further enhance agility and innovation through emerging technologies. Third, managerial innovations require greater flexibility from information systems in the enterprise. These include, among others, the rise of digital platforms and business ecosystems, end-to-end process integration, agile business organization, and continuous development and integration (Aral et al., 2024). Fourth, new types of enterprise systems and other information systems in the enterprise enhance value creation for old and new stakeholders, justifying significant investment while necessitating more sophisticated approaches for their design, development, governance, and operations (see further, Nah et al., 2001; Scott & Vessey, 2002; Dong et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2014; Haki et al., 2020; Mikalef et al., 2020; Flak et al., 2022).",
        "The future of information systems in the enterprise is complex. IS practice must adapt to technological, managerial, and organizational innovations while IS research may need to integrate insights from work on enterprise systems, enterprise architecture, as well as IS governance, digital transformation, IS sourcing, and digital platforms. This special issue aims to address these challenges by inviting disciplinary and interdisciplinary submissions that provide important insights on the direction and future of information systems in the enterprise. Specifically, “The Future of Information Systems in the Enterprise” special issue seeks to generate new knowledge that addresses key practical or theoretical challenges."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Digital threats continue to impede information assurance. Many issues in information assurance have arisen in the last decade or two, including risk management, information quality, intellectual property, privacy protection, compliance with regulations, and continuity of operations (Mahmood et al., 2010; Forrest, 2023). As a result, protecting information has become a global priority, and collaborative efforts are being made to prevent, detect, and react to threats to information quality, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability (European Parliament, 2018; White House, 2023a). As society steps into the age of generative AI (GenAI) (Dennehy et. al., 2023), fresh challenges and opportunities are arising in the realms of information security, privacy, and quality. Questions have emerged regarding the role and intended/unintended consequences of GenAI in information assurance. GenAI is believed to pose a paradox, serving as a dual-edged sword in the realm of information assurance (Robidoux, 2024).",
        "GenAI creates new content, whereas traditional AI mostly makes predictions and classifications based on existing datasets. GenAI is designed to reason and operate independently across various domains, whereas traditional AI focuses on narrow tasks (e.g., playing chess and translating languages by following specific rules). In addition, GenAI works with multiple data modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos), whereas traditional AI primarily functions in a single mode of data. These new capabilities of GenAI open new possibilities for its applications in a wide range of areas. GenAI models can range from generalized models to domain-specific models that automate tasks and generate content adhering to industry-specific terminologies, context-specialized knowledge, and tailored experiences. Its power has sparked discussions on ethics and societal questions regarding the potential impact on employment, bias, privacy, and human-AI relationships.",
        "The emergence of GenAI is poised to exert a profound impact on assurance (Barrett et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). On the one hand, GenAI has been recognized for its ability to bolster information assurance. The IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) commented that GenAI has the potential to strengthen business defenses, accelerate security processes, and identify emerging threats as they arise. Studies have also noted that GenAI may be able to address information management challenges, including quality (Bhatti, 2024). On the other hand, GenAI heightens the potency of existing threats, allows the fabrication of false information, fuels intellectual property theft, and poses challenges to governance and compliance. The 2024 February deepfake fraud incident in Hong Kong is a case in point (Chen & Magramo, 2024). Even unexpected users can threaten the protection of data, which is manifested by examples of employees sharing confidential data with GenAI models. Industry reports from Forrester (2023), Cisco (2024), and the IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) have highlighted GenAI-induced risks to information assurance as a major threat to firms’ adoption and implementation of GenAI initiatives. Similar concerns have been acknowledged from a government perspective in the 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (White House, 2023b) and the 2023 congressional research report: Generative Artificial Intelligence and Data Privacy: A Primer (Congressional Research Service, 2023).",
        "Examples of how GenAI may exacerbate information assurance issues include:",
        "Sophisticated human-deception attacks: Cybercriminals can use GenAI to compromise businesses by writing targeted emails. In addition, GenAI can create deepfakes and voice clones, resulting in “vishing” that uses phone calls and voice messages to trick people into sharing sensitive information.",
        "Hallucination and confabulation: GenAI is known to create incorrect information that is seemingly correct. In addition, attackers may trick GenAI into recommending unverified software code packages to unexpected users. When attackers embed malicious codes into packages endorsed by GenAI, users may unwittingly download and utilize these harmful codes, creating security vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation.",
        "Intellectual property theft: GenAI can create materials that violate intellectual property rights. For example, GenAI can create content that resembles existing copyrighted materials, resulting in legal ramifications and conflicts.",
        "Challenges in regulation and compliance: Keeping GenAI models in check is subject to considerable hurdles because of how intricate and swiftly they evolve. Ensuring compliance with data protection laws and standards will become increasingly difficult as GenAI becomes more autonomous and capable of making independent decisions.",
        "Another source of threats to information assurance stems from attacks that are designed to target the way GenAI systems are trained and expected to be used. Many of these attacks can be mitigated by explicitly integrating information assurance considerations when designing GenAI systems. For example, GenAI tools may be subject to:",
        "Unreliable training data: A substantial amount of training data is employed in constructing large language models (LLMs). Yet this data may be of low quality and is often unverified. The security of the models is influenced by the quality of the training data, paving the way for potential vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and compromises regarding sensitive information.",
        "Data poisoning: GenAI needs to be trained and tuned on inputs and outputs. Data poisoning occurs when inputs are manipulated to alter or corrupt the training data in LLMs, which consequently impacts the desired outputs of the overall system.",
        "Security leaks, inference attacks, and knowledge phishing: Security leaks in the context of GenAI refer to the unintended disclosure of sensitive information embedded within a model itself or through its responses. This is also known as inference attacks or knowledge phishing.",
        "Prompt injections: Prompt injections occur when malicious inputs are provided to an AI system to manipulate its output or to execute unintended actions.",
        "Cisco (2024) found that 92% of organizations “see GenAI as fundamentally different, requiring new techniques to manage data and risks.” The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls for actions on refining GenAI by mitigating information assurance issues (White House, 2023b). Worldwide efforts are being made on these fronts to protect LLMs against threats of information fabrication, system misuse, privacy breaches, etc. Gartner recommends mitigation strategies, which include “establishing a governance entity and workflow, monitoring and blocking access, communicating acceptable use policies, exploring prompt engineering and API integrations, and prioritizing private hosting options” (Robidoux, 2024). However, there are growing concerns that excessive focus and regulation on data security and privacy may stifle and slow the advancement of GenAI, especially in terms of the European Union’s AI Act (Timis, 2023).",

        "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that there are approximately 110 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, as of mid-2023, because of persecution, conflict, war, violence, human rights violations or events seriously disturbing public order. These include 36.4 million refugees and 62.5 million internally displaced people (IDP), asylum seekers, and several other people in need of international protection. There is a strong history of research highlighting the issues faced by refugees, ranging from accounts of violence in the developing world, exploring the gendered experience of refugees, questioning racist thinking about immigration, case studies of asylum seekers, and philosophical inquiry into the fair treatment of refugees. The global refugee and forced migration crisis and the persistent challenges faced by these vulnerable communities call for an urgent need for innovative solutions that foster social inclusion and empower these populations.",
        "In our field, information systems (IS) researchers have been acutely aware of the refugee and migrant crises. Researchers have examined the critical issues related to social inclusion of refugees, social inclusion and activation of refugee agency, information and communication technology (ICT) enabled refugee integration, refugees and pedagogy, digitization and refugee settlement, refugee women and information-precarity, and migrant identity. Researchers in sister fields have explored digitally mediated experiences of refugees, building a technology-oriented humanitarian research framework for field researchers, the emergence of new digital landscape in refugee management, new forms of data colonialism and humanitarian response to refugee crises, data governance and data justice, datafication and refugees subjectivities, feminist and decolonial approaches to examine displacement issues, and participatory design and decolonization in the context of refugee account.",
        "Nonetheless, recent research in refugee studies has shown that critical areas at the intersection of technology, refugees, and broader migration crises have remained underexamined, for example, social media and device vetting, digitally mediated lived experiences of minority refugees, refugees and a sense of uncertainty in the digital age, refugee aid and digital capitalism, and networked refugees. Technological advances like AI-based refugee settlement applications and Blockchain-based fundraising solutions and identity management solutions have started to emerge, and it is unclear how critical technological advances will shape issues related to technology, power, and control in the sensitive context of refugees and migrants. Further, new forms of sociopolitical digital problems have started to emerge within refugee contexts such as digital colonialism and refugees, gender violence and sexual minority refugees, and critical race issues of refugees and digital coloniality. We observe that despite some progress in our field, much remains underexplored in addressing these pressing issues, underscoring the need for rigorous research. This special issue aims to explore how IS research could contribute to illuminating the refugee crises and alleviating the deterioration of refugee and migrant social circumstances.",
        "These sensitive topics are situated within the broader debate on digital inclusion and empowerment and the discussions related to inequality and demarginalization and decolonization in our field. Exploring the critical research questions surrounding IS and migrant/refugee populations is essential for developing comprehensive and ‘good’ IS solutions and making the world a better place for all of us. This special issue aims to provide valuable theoretical and practical contributions to scholars, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers by delving into the multifaceted dimensions of technologies and their role in addressing specific issues related to refugees and migrant populations. We invite high-quality research papers that shed light on the innovative applications, challenges, and opportunities presented by technology in the context of refugees and migrant communities."

In particular, we encourage submissions linked to any of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) identified by the United Nations, as well as work dealing with technologies that are transforming the world in which we live, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
        "Design science research (DSR) deals with the design of artifacts to solve identifiable problems and the abstraction of knowledge from that process. In its original conceptualization, DSR has been popularly characterized as research that 'created and evaluates IT artifact intended to solve identified organizational problems' (Hevner et al., 2004, p. 77, emphasis added). More broadly, there is a recognition that DSR leads to artifacts that 'serve human purposes' (March and Smith, 1995, p. 253). In particular, DSR can serve as an approach to tackle many of the wicked problems facing society today, including poverty, health, environmental degradation, climate change, disinformation, and terrorism.",
        "Recent studies in Decision Support Systems (DSS) have notably contributed to SDGs, spanning from enhancing healthcare quality (e.g., Ojo et al., 2024) to optimizing resource efficiency (e.g., Ge et al., 2024). Storey et al. (2024) emphasized the significance of integrating human-AI synergies in sociotechnical DSS design. Transparency is pivotal in advocating responsible DSR practices and design artifacts (Hevner et al., 2024).",
        "Recent DSR publications reflect a growing consensus within the community regarding the imperative to advance sustainable development. Strobel, et al. (2023) leveraged AI to translate sign language and improve participation of individuals with hearing difficulties in social activities. Wass, Thygesen, and Purao (2023) designed and deployed information systems to promote the social inclusion of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. With both DSR projects, the authors improved access to quality healthcare and equality. Other examples focus on promoting ecological sustainability, such as Schoormann, Stadtländer, and Knackstedt (2022) and Seidel, et al. (2018). Pan, et al. (2021) conducted an Action Design Research to support wildlife management for the purpose of environmental protection.",
        "Examples such as these demonstrate the promise of DSR as a research paradigm for tangible societal impacts. With this special issue, we hope to encourage fellow design science researchers to create even greater impacts together."

        "This special issue explores the multifaceted impacts of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and related technologies on various domains. It delves into both the advantages and potential pitfalls of GenAI, highlighting its profound influence on individuals, businesses, and society at large. The issue examines the integration of AI in business strategies across different sectors, underscoring how AI's increasing sophistication is transforming marketplaces and decision-making processes.",
        "The recent rapid development of GenAI and its application in various industries is expected to have a dramatic impact on individuals, organizations, and societies. AI has been incorporated into digital business strategies, including applications such as expert systems, machine learning, robotics, natural language processing, machine vision, or speech recognition. The implementation of AI-powered technologies, such as service robots, chatbots, smart speakers, and other intelligent assistants, is already delivering new services and increasingly interacting with customers in various sectors such as banking, hospitality, tourism, and healthcare. AI is becoming increasingly sophisticated and is transforming the marketplace and affecting decision-making as a result.",
        "From a company perspective, AI implementation can generate value via process automation, improved decision-making, and customer engagement. Therefore, the success of AI initiatives is based on their expected benefits, such as customer experience, service quality, and productivity. However, users may also experience costs from interacting with AI applications. The use of AI in business strategy still holds several open questions, and previous studies have suggested that the development of new AI applications presents many challenges.",
        "Recent advances in AI, including generative AI, offer new opportunities but have also raised several concerns. GenAI produces new content in the form of human-like discourse, and its widespread use is becoming more common. GenAI may have significant implications for business practice across several sectors, as well as in activities such as marketing and management. Thus, there is a need to understand GenAI applications and their positive and negative consequences for consumers, companies, and society.",
        "Previous literature has identified several ethical implications in the context of AI use that require further analysis from various perspectives. The widespread use of GenAI across domains presents opportunities and challenges that need to be effectively understood to maximize benefits while mitigating negative effects. This dual approach will help ensure that the adoption of GenAI aligns with ethical, practical, and sustainable standards."

        "Organizations of the 21st century face a seemingly indeterminable array of emerging digital technologies, which are radically novel and rapidly evolving, with profound transformative potential (Rotolo et al., 2015). Like past non-digital examples such as the steam engine or the electric motor, current emerging digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, 5G, 3D printing, smart manufacturing and energy, genomics and precision medicine, drones, augmented reality, and autonomous vehicles are transforming markets and societies, as well as the very core of how we organize (Bohn et al., 2023). These and other technologies generate such an impact because they are increasingly ‘autonomous’ and ‘intelligent’, which complements, augments, and even replaces human action (Bailey et al., 2022; Gümüsay et al., 2023). Another feature fueling the transformative potential of emerging digital technologies is their connectivity – devices are interwoven in ways previously unthinkable (Adner et al., 2019). In addition, many current emerging digital technologies exhibit broad applicability across domains (Gambardella et al., 2021; Teece, 2018). They are thus general-purpose technologies (Bresnahan & Trajtenberg, 1995) and in many cases advance to essential infrastructures across markets (Bohn et al., 2020). Finally, many of these emerging technologies exhibit an unprecedented pace of diffusion and adoption. Notably, OpenAI's ChatGPT reached one million users in a mere 5 days – compared with the several decades it took for non-digital innovations like the telephone to gain a similar level of user adoption.",
        "Building on a rich tradition in innovation theory (Jon & Delbecq, 1977; Tushman & Anderson, 1986) and organization studies (Child & Mansfield, 1972; Daft, 1978), scholars have examined the interplay of emerging digital technologies and organizing on multiple levels. Across levels, it has been argued to put relations center stage, thus conceptualize emerging digital technologies as being made of relations and entwined in relations that are constantly evolving (Bailey et al., 2022; Reischauer & Hoffmann, 2023). In addition, an emerging stream of research perceives the link between emerging digital technologies and organizations as sociomaterial where the social and the material are intertwined and mutually influence each other (Glaser et al., 2021; Moser et al., 2021; Orlikowski & Scott, 2023). At the industry level, institutional theory has emerged as an important lens to explain large-scale changes of enterprise systems, firms, and societies related to emerging digital technologies (Berente et al., 2019; Burton-Jones et al., 2020; Gegenhuber et al., 2022a; Hinings et al., 2018). One set of studies has shown that, in order to promote emerging digital technologies, organizations redefine and work institutions by championing standards (Garud et al., 2002; Vasudeva et al., 2014). Others have shown that the meaning and scope of these technologies was shaped by boundary work interwoven with field-configuring events (Liao, 2016). Recent advances point out that these organizational efforts to promote and shape emerging digital technologies can result in redefined institutional infrastructure (Gegenhuber et al., 2022a; Gegenhuber et al., 2022b; Logue & Grimes, 2022). Shaping institutions to push emerging digital technologies has also been shown to be important to navigate large scale crises such as the COVID19 pandemic (Faik et al., 2020; Gkeredakis et al., 2021; Oborn et al., 2021).",
        "Focusing on the role of relationships between organizations and other forms of organizing for emerging digital technologies and thus the inter-organizational level, scholars have shown how members of social movements and (online) communities draw upon fluid sets of these technologies to coordinate collective action across regional boundaries (Braccini et al., 2019; Gümüsay et al., 2022; Leong et al., 2020; Young et al., 2019) and to mobilize digital technologies to connect and cultivate markets for social impact and investment (Logue & Grimes, 2022). Moreover, studies found that, to assess their potential impact, organizations set up cross-industry cooperation that enabled an open learning climate, prevented intrafirm power struggles, and rendered the development of ‘common sense’ unnecessary due to a focus on parallel perspectives on potential impacts (Gattringer et al., 2021). Likewise, there are first indications of the relevance of meta-organizations for emerging digital technologies (Berkowitz & Bor, 2017; Reischauer et al., 2021). Meta-organizations (or boundary organizations) are legally autonomous organizations that coordinate different organizations following a system-level goal (Gulati et al., 2012; Perkmann & Schildt, 2015). Consider “Farm of the Future” where researchers, farmers, and agencies co-develop digital agricultural solutions to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture.",
        "Studies situated at the (intra-)organizational level identified distinct structures and management innovations that co-evolve with technologies as to profit from and implement them (Akhlaghpour & Lapointe, 2018; Bohn et al., 2023; Kapoor & Klueter, 2021; Khanagha et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2008; van Doren et al., 2022). Moreover, attention of managers to these technologies and multiple initiatives in different units are key to secure sufficient resources to the technology and to enable experimental learning (Khanagha et al., 2017).",
        "Despite these advances, we yet don’t have an in-depth understanding of the interrelated processes, structures, and practices through which people, collectives, organizations, and other forms of organizing push these technologies forward and, even more interestingly, try to push back. Specifically, there is a need for studies exploring the various ways that organizations – alone or by collaborating with others – organize for and around constantly evolving emerging digital technologies on and across various levels. In addition, we need to better understand how organizations attempt to hinder certain emerging digital technologies in their further development or cope with the failure of collectively backed emerging technologies – such as 3D television or augmented reality glasses. To overcome these limits, this special issue aims to create a forum for state-of-the-art research on the processes, structures, and practices of organizing for and against emerging digital technologies across levels. We invite different types of conceptual and empirical work situated in various contexts, including but not limited to for-profit organizations, public administration, politics, and social movements. Given the potential impact of emerging digital technologies, we especially welcome empirical work situated in critical infrastructure sectors (such as food and agriculture, healthcare, energy, water, waste, communications sector, and information technology).",
        "Recognizing the multifaceted nature of emerging digital technologies, we invite submissions that span a spectrum of approaches, from focused information systems studies to interdisciplinary research integrating insights from management, sociology, psychology, law, and other relevant fields. Next, we provide a non-exhaustive list of questions that would be of interest for this special issue."

        "JMIS, a top-tier scholarly journal, invites the best papers addressing the components of the potential emergence of the Metaverse as a complement to and a potential replacement for the current Web. The Metaverse is envisioned as a collection of technologies and initiatives intended to create a next-generation Internet (Web3) that is highly immersive, persistent, in 3D, and based on the latest developments in extended reality (XR)—an umbrella term for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR)—as supplemented by artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, quantum computing, and other supporting technologies. Given the compelling and disruptive potential for the Metaverse to generate the Web3, several of the world’s leading technology companies are investing tens of billions of dollars on related software and hardware to foster this market, including Meta, Microsoft, Snapchat, Amazon, NVIDIA, Epic Games, and Apple.",
        "This is an opportune time for researchers to examine what can be learned from the past failed efforts of AR/VR platforms such as Second Life and over-hyped failed AR technologies like Google Glass, and to examine the many more successes that are occurring, perhaps more quietly, with XR in education, manufacturing, gaming, branding, healthcare, retailing, logistics, aerospace and defense, architecture, advertising, and athletics. It is these successes and disruptive business models that are likely to form what will be known as the Metaverse. However, this is no minor feat, just as the Internet as we know it took decades to develop. To create a truly persistent 3D, virtual, and immersive Metaverse, there will need to be further advances in supporting hardware (goggles, headsets, sensors), and an exponential increase in computing power, storage, and memory. If the Metaverse is to succeed it must be based on making things better for people than the status quo, and thus must foster innovative business models that are profitable, and yet foster interoperability, efficiency, remote work, reliability, fairness, accountability, open governance, inclusivity, safety, community, and to do so in a manner that is sustainable environmentally, socially and ethically.",
        "This is the time for scientists to work with policy makers, companies, and not-for-profit organizations to break the current social media models and envision a Metaverse that can best serve collective global needs. Accordingly, we are pleased to announce a Special Issue on this subject at JMIS. Importantly, information systems (IS) researchers have long contributed to the foundational research that can serve as building blocks for the Metaverse, including but not limited to XR (i.e., VR, AR, MR), avatars, agents, gamification, and gaming. Meanwhile, IS researchers are presently leading key research on the Metaverse itself. Our strong preference is for contributions of original and rigorous theory-guided behavioral or empirical data around information systems artifacts that inform design, practice, research, and the products and foundations of theory of meaningful aspects of the Metaverse. We seek any methodological approaches that are legitimate and rigorous, and that can shed light on important phenomena related to the Metaverse. However, we are not seeking review papers or those that focus on discussions of further research alone."

        "Generative AI, which refers to artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that generate original outputs based on prompt inputs, has the potential to fundamentally transform the way people create and consume content online. Unlike previous generations of AI systems, which were primarily designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, Generative AI synthesizes the data it has been trained on and creates content in the form of images, text, audio, video, and more that is similar to content created by human experts – but in much less time, at a fraction of the cost, and with amazing creativity. In this special issue, we focus on the opportunities and challenges that Generative AI poses for digital platforms. Over the past two decades, social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube, mobile app platforms such as Apple’s App Store, e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, freelance platforms such as Upwork, and sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb and Uber have reshaped and disrupted entire industries. What these platform companies have in common is that they create value by facilitating interactions and the exchange of goods and services between two or more groups that would have been difficult or impossible to connect in the absence of the platform. Information systems (IS) scholars have made important contributions to the literature on digital platforms, much of which has been focused on the complex relationship between the triumvirate of users, complementors (i.e., those who contribute content to the platforms such as app developers or video creators), and the platform provider, which together form the platform ecosystem.",
        "In the context of digital platforms, all stakeholders, and their interactions with one another, can be transformed by Generative AI. For example, Generative AI can enable unprecedented forms of personalization (i.e., hyper-personalization), allowing complementors to instantly tailor their offerings to meet the preferences of each individual user. However, complementors in particular may also feel threatened by the technology’s disruptive potential. For instance, research has shown that the introduction of a Generative AI system on a crowdsourcing platform can motivate complementors to either leave the platform or shift their efforts to more complex contests to avoid competing directly with the new system. While all platform stakeholders can draw on Generative AI to save countless hours of human labor and enhance the user experience in various platform settings, we are only beginning to understand the transformative value of the technology for digital platforms.",
        "Especially since the introduction of ChatGPT 3 by OpenAI in 2022, Generative AI is experiencing rapid growth, with Gartner predicting that 30% of outbound messages will be synthetically generated by 2025. As a major paradigm shift, Generative AI will continue to revolutionize the way we use, govern, and understand digital platforms, creating a wealth of opportunities for individuals, teams, organizations, and society. However, there are also concerns that Generative AI will lead to job displacement, as the technology becomes capable of performing tasks that were previously done by humans. IS researchers have contributed important insights on fundamental questions regarding the implications of AI for business as well as how the technology could and should be managed. However, with the emergence of Generative AI, new research avenues are opening up, providing an opportunity for IS scholars to conduct leading research on the transformative and value-creating capacity of this fascinating technology, especially with regard to digital platforms.",
        "As a disruptive technology, Generative AI can enable truly innovative services and business models that engage all platform stakeholders in unprecedented ways. It could disrupt entire platform industries, sending them into a downward spiral while providing groundbreaking opportunities for others. Despite this promise as a game changer, the interplay between the Generative AI’s inherent potential and its transformative value for digital platforms is poorly understood and requires further research. This is an area where IS scholars are well-equipped to contribute to the discussion through cutting-edge research. Rather than addressing the operational and tactical merits of Generative AI, this special issue provides a dedicated forum for IS and other scholars to engage in an important dialogue on its strategic and managerial implications.",
        "In particular, we are interested in the transformative value of Generative AI for digital platforms and the impact of Generative AI on the various stakeholders in a digital platform ecosystem, including complementors, users, and platform providers. The transformative value of Generative AI for complementors includes changing the way they deliver products and services, lowering barriers to entry by shortening development times and enabling even novice complementors without technical backgrounds to engage in tasks such as app development, potentially increasing competition among complementors. The transformative value of Generative AI for users includes providing platform users with powerful creative tools that promise productivity gains in creating content, making it easier for them to express themselves and share their ideas with others. The transformative value of Generative AI for platform providers includes changes in how users and complementors act and interact, leading to new dynamics that need to be evaluated and considered."

        "The 21st Century has been termed “the century of disasters” (Achenbach 2011). These include natural and human-caused disasters. The former encompass geophysical (e.g., earthquakes), hydrological (e.g., floods), climatological (e.g., wildfires), meteorological (e.g., cyclones), or biological (e.g., disease epidemics such as COVID-19) disasters. The latter are caused by human-led events, such as conflicts, famine, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity incidents, and industrial accidents (IFRC 2010). A myriad of factors has contributed to a surge in disasters: technological innovation, population growth, climate change, demographic changes, and evolving social dynamics. When they happen, such disasters exact a devastating toll on civil and technical infrastructure and society as a whole (e.g., loss of human life, social and economic disturbances, and environmental damage.",
        "In extreme cases where natural and human-caused disasters join forces, the suffering of victims often increases exponentially. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 has added a new threat to refugees and humanitarian resettlement programs (CDC 2020). The International Rescue Committee (2020) commented that “People in refugee camps in Syria, Greece and Bangladesh face a heightened risk of COVID-19 due to more densely populated conditions than even the Diamond Princess—the cruise ship where transmission of the virus was four times faster than in Wuhan.”",
        "Worldwide, government agencies, private sectors, and the public are in desperate search for new tools, practices, and strategies to safeguard society against the threat of disasters (Chen et al. 2013; Park et al. 2015). For policy makers, Information technology (IT) has been considered important in enabling and supporting efficient and effective disaster management. In recognition of the potential role of IT, as early as 2007, the United States Congress followed the E-government Act of 2002 to direct the National Research Council to study the application of IT to disaster management. Over the past decade, the world has seen an increasing level of IT use in modern disaster management (Beydoun et al. 2018). Examples include blockchain for disaster logistics, wearable technologies for rescue teams and victims, remote monitoring sensors for intelligence gathering, virtual reality for response preparedness and training, GIS for crisis mapping, social media for disaster information dissemination and extraction of real-time intelligence, and big data for impact assessment and forecasting. Such IT uses have been found across the globe.",
        "Management of disasters is challenging for its multi-phase, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder, multi-task, multi-objective nature. First, disaster management follows multiple phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In the example of the preparedness phase, efforts are taken to develop a single- or all-hazard disaster plan, evaluate and modify the plan, exercise the plan (e.g., table-top exercises or drills), and stock inventory (e.g., water and food). These phases are interconnected as the performance of one response phase affects that of the next phase. Second, disaster management calls for different specialties and strategies in response to various disaster types, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass shootings, earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, hurricanes, and train derailments. For example, management of pandemic and terrorist attacks focus on responding to and containing a disaster after its appearance (i.e., reactionary), whereas floods and hurricanes necessitate proactive mitigation strategies in anticipation of the disaster. Third, disaster management involves a broad stakeholder approach, potentially encompassing international coalitions (e.g., the U.N.), local government, public safety and security (e.g., Fire, Police, and Hazmat), logistics providers, public health and medical services, humanitarian / social society organizations, military, transportation, utility and public works, donors, media, and business/civilian victims. While these stakeholders might agree on the general principle of social good, their exact goals and objectives might vary (Abbasi et al. 2019). Fourth, disaster management handles a wide range of operations, such as unified command, situational assessment, coordinated operations, risk assessment (Tinsley et al. 2011; Dillion and Tinsley 2008), impact analysis, resource allocation, victim assistance, supply chain and logistics, and financing. Fifth, disaster management works to achieve objectives such as preserving lives and properties, containing the impact, protecting the health and safety of response personnel, safeguarding the natural environment, sustaining business and civilian activities, protecting critical infrastructures, informing the public, and restoring and rebuilding affected communities. Finally, disaster management consists of mitigation of harm in the disaster context, which may include examination of harms and harm quantification, tracing the impact of harm and identifying susceptible population, and dissemination of harm.",
        "To help policy makers, IT can provide strategic support that addresses each aspect of disaster management. In the example of multi-stakeholder support, IT can be used to interconnect stakeholders for building response partnerships. In doing so, it is also important to avoid IT misuse which may create digital chaos and impede first responders and other offline disaster management activities; for instance, human- or bot-led propagation of false information on social media. The security and privacy issues of IT use surrounding disaster management is also an important consideration. Compared with other disciplines (e.g., Management Science), scholars in IS have been relatively silent about disaster management – new findings on the proper design, use, and management of IT can undoubtedly have a huge real-world impact. IS research in disaster management may be performed at multiple levels: individual, organizational, and social. Different methods, such as qualitative, quantitative, data science, and design science can all contribute to building a stronger body of knowledge."

        "Life transitions forms a rich area of scholarship for Information Science research. The last five years have seen a steady growth in the publication of empirical studies related to transition, including PhD work and longitudinal studies, in a variety of areas including health, social, academic and employment contexts. At the same time, emerging conceptual work has also started to re-examine transition through a historical lens, including how change and adjustment has been treated in historical Information Science scholarship. This adds significant scope for complex conceptual work. The breadth of interest further means that transition has the potential to unify various related fields of study, including information behaviour, practice, and literacy research as well as various disciplinary fields. This Special Issue will provide a platform for the exploration of life transitions from an information behaviour, information practice, or information literacy perspective. The aim is to develop the emerging conceptualisation of what transition means in these fields of study through examining different theoretical models, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. This Special Issue will act as focal point for growing theoretical and empirical interest in the relationship between life transitions and information.",
        "Transitions are a natural state in everyday life. In a broader sense, individuals could be said to be in a constant state of transition, or 'transitioning' with every passage in life. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, transition is defined both as a noun and adverb, it is both: 'A passing or passage from one condition, action, or (rarely) place, to another; 'change' and, 'To make or undergo a transition (from one state, system, etc. to or into another); to change over or switch.' From a research perspective, transition is a complex topic that has been variously conceptualised and defined. Transitions can be personal (changes due to changes in life cycle), situational (changes in circumstances in personal or professional life), or environmental (changes in the organisational environment impacting individuals) (Schumacher & Meleis, 1994). These emphases mean that transition has been most comprehensively explored to date within the field of Education and Nursing. Conceptual work in these areas has focused on the process through which people in transition move beyond a disrupted reality to construct a new reality.",
        "Information has been found to be a strong trigger in the transition process. Transitions fracture the individual’s information landscapes and require them to learn new 'ways of knowing' (Lloyd, 2017), a process that often requires both seeking and avoiding information as a coping mechanism to reduce uncertainty (Savolainen, 2017). This notion of a 'gappy' reality (Dervin, 1999, p. 370) resonates with sense-making’s premise of discontinuity (Dervin, 2003) as a fundamental aspect of reality that mandates humans to 'take steps to construct sense in constantly changing life situations.' (Savolainen, 1993, p. 16).",
        "Although transitions are permeated with information practices of many kinds, information behaviour/practices/literacy research has engaged only peripherally with ideas of transition and the concept remains underexplored. Consequently, the aim of this special issue is to extend these initial explorations of transition through an information lens."

      "paragraphs": [
        "General web search engines are an essential part of today's information infrastructure. They have made it possible to find almost anything on the Internet by typing a few keywords into an empty search box. In fact, search engines have become so integrated into devices and practices that you can get an answer before you even knew how to phrase the question. Search engines shape our lives and at the same time shape the society and culture we live in. We use them at work, in school, in research, in planning our vacations, in finding products, and in politics – just to name a few important areas.",
        "The search engine market is dominated by a few companies that have divided the market into regions: Baidu in China, Yandex in Russia and Google in much of the Western world. More competition between search engines is often called for, but is very difficult to achieve. On the other side, we find the content providers doing everything they can by employing various types of search engine optimization (SEO) to achieve the highest rank in the search engine results page when people search for information.",
        "In information science, search engines have been studied mainly in the subfield of information retrieval and information behaviour. The study of search engines has thus been a core task of information science since the discipline's beginnings in the 1960s and even before (Saracevic, 2009). With concepts such as relevance or precision and recall, the evaluation of effectiveness has often been the focus of research. While general web search engines play an extremely important role in today's information infrastructure - economically, culturally, politically, technically, etc. - and have become an integral part of daily life at many levels, information science has only partially embraced the role of general web search engines in society. Research is fragmented into different subfields of information science and these fields do not always communicate well with each other. In this special issue, we call on information science researchers to join us in the investigation of general web search engines, also from outside Information Retrieval.",
        "Information science can look back on a long and rich tradition of studying search and search systems. Relevance, one of the most central concepts for even contemporary search engines, has its origin in the field (Saracevic, 1975). Still, there are some blind spots, especially what role different types of relevance play when it comes to search engines (cf. Sundin, Lewandowski & Haider, 2021). These search engines index a plethora of content and have a very low quality threshold when it comes to including documents in their indexes. Therefore, ranking results in a way that benefits users and at the same time provides societal relevance is paramount.",
        "From a technical viewpoint, information retrieval research has contributed to search engines by developing indexing methods (e.g., Sparck Jones, 1972) and ranking algorithms, with link-based algorithms being based on central ideas from information science, namely citation analysis (Garfield, 1979). Evaluation campaigns such as TREC (Haarman & Voorhees, 2006) and CLEF (Ferro & Peters, 2019) have developed solid methods and procedures to thoroughly test search engines. On the user side, information science research has contributed to the development and understanding of search engines through developing information-seeking models (e.g., Bates, 1989; Kuhlthau, 2003; Belkin, Oddy & Brooks, 1982) that are used in system development (White, 2016).",
        "Information behaviour research has also produced a large body of empirical work on people's behaviour when looking for and using information. Information science, with its rich tradition of studying these topics, provides a good starting point for investigating today's search engines (Haider & Sundin, 2019; Lewandowski, Sünkler & Schultheiß, 2020; Lewandowski et al., 2021). As the field is interdisciplinary, it can also serve as a hub for integrating research from other fields.",
        "Search engines and their use (search) are studied in different disciplines and from different theoretical perspectives. In addition to information science, information studies, and LIS, the topic has been addressed in disciplines as diverse as science and technology studies (STS), media and communication studies, political science, economics, education, psychology, HCI, or informatics, to name a few. Media-centred and device-centered research exists alongside people-centred studies and research that focuses on society, economics, or politics. While some focus on search engine use in general (e.g., Halavais 2018), others examine specific commercial search engines such as Google (e.g., Hillis et al. 2012), as well as Yandex, Baidu, or various regional services (e.g., Zavadski & Toepfl 2019). Some studies focus on specific groups such as teenagers (e.g., Andersson 2017) or the elderly (Sanchiz et al. 2017), settings, or professions (e.g., Gudmundsdottir and Hartlevik 2020), and others focus on search engine use in relation to other platforms such as social media (e.g., Delmastro & Splendore 2021).",
        "More recently, with the emergence of critical algorithm studies and critical AI, the focus has been on the various ways in which Google in particular may be implicated in society's information disorders and problems with misinformation and algorithmic biases that reinforce prejudice and injustice (e.g., Noble, 2018; Puschmann 2019). Another angle has been the central role of Google in capitalism (Bilić 2018; Mager, 2012), while others have examined the role of commercial search engines in reinforcing confirmation biases, partisanship, or hostile media effects (e.g., Tripodi 2018). Although search engines have been studied from many different angles and for a relatively long time, the field is extremely scattered. Not only is there little awareness of each other's work across disciplines, but even across subfields there are few connections. Different disciplinary investigations run in parallel and rarely meet in a productive way. Furthermore, the more commercial search engines fade into the background, the more difficult it becomes to perceive and study them. Moreover, their functioning is largely opaque and beyond the control of society, which in many cases means that the data available for research remains speculative. This may require creative approaches to data collection and methodology, as well as research designs that are open to new influences and experimental tactics.",
        "This Call for Papers is based on the premise that different approaches need to benefit from each other. We are looking for contributions that broaden the respective disciplinary, methodological, or empirical perspectives to identify and explore commercial search engines and their use and role in society from new angles, or that bring together different approaches in original ways. In particular, we would like to encourage information science/information studies, broadly understood, to reposition themselves and contribute the discipline's expertise to shed light on the ever more powerful role of commercial search engines in almost all areas of society and everyday life, influencing not only how we know and what we know, but increasingly also how knowledge and information are created and communicated, to begin with. The guest-editors welcome papers representing a variety of approaches. Papers can be theoretical, conceptual or empirical or combinations thereof."

        "This special issue, “Healthier Information Ecosystems,” will focus on the interconnected nature of online pathologies, draw attention to the socio-technical aspects of information technology, and animate interdisciplinary approaches to addressing these problems. Similar to Buckminster Fuller’s mission of “World Game,” we want to aid in developing a wide variety of solutions (including but not limited to technical, political, social, and educational) to the wicked problems of our time to make “the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest period of time… without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.”",
        "We invite contributions that address the socio-cultural embeddedness of the problems plaguing information ecosystems and provide new ways of thinking about and strategies to achieve a healthier global information environment. We are actively seeking a broad approach to issues of healthier information ecosystems, including both theoretical and applied, qualitative and quantitative, as well as inside and outside the discipline of information science and technology. We are interested in transdisciplinary contributions that move beyond narrow, cross-sectional treatments of online phenomena to highlight the socio-technical dynamics of online spaces framed in cultural-historical contexts. As Rong Tang (Tang et al., 2021) and colleagues mentioned in their 2021 JASIST piece, information science is experiencing a paradigm shift and the need to better understand the socio-technical side of information technology is central to this change.",
        "There is no shortage of research examining the pathological aspects of our modern information ecosystems, covering a broad spectrum of socio-technical phenomena including (but not limited to) misinformation, toxicity, polarization, and extremism. Together, these phenomena might be considered to be a sign of an “unhealthy” information ecosystem. However, our collective understanding of the problem remains fragmented and incomplete, impeding our ability to identify and implement successful solutions. For this special issue, we seek papers that take an interdisciplinary approach to expanding our understanding of information ecosystems by answering such vital questions as: What does it mean to live in an unhealthy information ecosystem, is it possible to envision a healthier one, and how do we get from here to there? While many of the problems in online settings have been examined in isolation, they are often intimately connected — each problem can be both cause and consequence of the others.",
        "We adopt an ecosystems framing to highlight such interconnectedness. The problems that now occupy many researchers’ work emerge from complex, technologically mediated networks and interconnected systems of people, institutions, and cultures that create, spread, organize, and amplify information. This complex system is a rich avenue for inquiry by the research community, but focusing on isolated aspects while neglecting their interrelationships will miss systemic opportunities to intervene. Moreover, problems like misinformation, toxicity, and polarization are influenced by contextual factors including social norms, economics, power structures, and worldviews. If we fail to examine information science and technology against this backdrop, stakeholders inside and outside of the academy are unlikely to identify realistic strategies for improving information ecosystems.",
        "We are eager to receive contributions from disciplines that might lend new perspectives, including (but not limited to) statistical physics, complex systems, biology, environmental science, economics, management science, organization science, communication, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy. All contributions should clarify how they can be used to help our information ecosystems work for the betterment of society at large, developing an inclusive and thus “healthy” ecosystem."

The first domain – regulation through IT – concerns new forms and arenas of regulation enacted through innovative IT solutions (often called “RegTech”). These technologies which are increasingly implicated in regulatory practices include new forms of real-time big data analytics, machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, use of blockchains and distributed ledgers, Internet of Things solutions or natural language processing techniques. These technologies change the ways organizations and industrial sectors respond to and comply with a growing number of regulatory obligations and needs. These technologies are also driving changes in the ways in which regulators seek to supervise and monitor firms and the ways in which firms comply with laws and regulations.",
        "The second domain – regulation of IT – is the wide range deployment and associated regulatory effects of new IT (e.g., concerns of security, privacy and/or safety). There is a notable gap in the field’s knowledge regarding new demands and ways of regulating IT given its scale, complexity and pervasive use. Concerns regarding the pervasive effects of platform businesses (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon etc.) on privacy, competition and information veracity have invited calls to control and scrutinize technology vendors. Similar issues are likely to emerge in autonomous cars, user-based insurance, health policies and so on. There are consequently increased demands to regulate various IT solutions and to increase regulatory powers of governments related to IT uses, including through introducing entirely new regulatory bodies. If platform providers and vendors, or organizations offering extensive algorithmic solutions as parts of their related services (e.g., Uber), are subjected to new regulatory structures, then important questions arise regarding what degrees of transparency and reporting are appropriate and how related forms of supervision and sanctioning would function that need to regulate actual systems and their functioning and those who are implicated in their design.",
        "We invite empirical and theoretical research that contribute to our understanding and application of how regulation is enacted through IT or how uses of IT can be regulated. We encourage submissions that use diverse epistemological and methodological approaches to focus on emerging and new regulatory solutions and practices. Submissions may engage in cross-disciplinary inquiries and should offer novel knowledge and fresh methodological, theoretical and empirical insights how regulation and IT evolve and are related. The papers will be evaluated for their interestingness, novelty and credibility of the contribution. If in doubt, interested authors should consult the special issue guest editors whether their papers fall within the scope of the special issue. To this end, authors are encouraged to submit an extended abstract to the editors for initial feedback."

        "The last decade has seen a significant proliferation of new technologies. These include robotic process automation, big data, machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain and other emerging technologies. Consulting and market research companies have consistently predicted that the current wave of technologies will transform both front and back office operations, requiring firms to rethink their business models and strategies. While evidence suggests that firms will continue to invest in emerging technologies, there has so far been little evidence about the involvement of service providers and advisory in the selection, design and adoption of such emerging technologies.",
        "IS sourcing research has conventionally accounted for three main areas of interest: sourcing decision, contractual structures and relationship management. Emerging technologies challenge these traditional conventions in the IS sourcing literature. Particular challenges include but are not limited to: greater dependency on data in emerging technologies, leading clients to source data science services; implementation often happens through platforms that involve multiple players and services; reduced relevance of the asset transfer model while client firms are still expected to reduce their headcount; greater emphasis on the redesign of the value chain as services become digitized and decisions driven by smart algorithms; and emerging technologies being viewed as a black box, posing skills and expertise challenges for firms to acquire and retain knowledge of the technology.",
        "Further, the IS sourcing literature which has traditionally relied on three main reference theories, namely, transaction cost economics, resource dependency and social exchange. Emerging technologies emphasize the need of expanding this theoretical base and accommodating new paradigms of capturing and analysing data in IS sourcing research. Taking into account the above observations, the IS sourcing literature thus begs for the re-examination of client-supplier-advisory relationships by challenging core concepts of sourcing decision, contractual structure and relationship management as offering new theoretical landscapes that accommodate the sourcing phenomenon in a digital age.",
        "This special issue seeks to facilitate an empirical and theoretical re-examination of IS sourcing in the light of the current wave of emerging technologies. We invite research papers that investigate issues relating to emerging technologies and IS sourcing. In particular, we take interest in issues concerning robotic process automation, big data, machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence and blockchain. Other technologies are less of interest for this special issue."

        "Disruptive digital innovations do not come without pain – the disorder that they introduce can create negative externalities and unintended consequences for people, communities, industries, and economies. In the worst case, there is disruption with little innovation. This can lead to job losses for individuals, loss of human dignity, negative health impacts, lost revenue for communities, obsolescence of industries, and loss of the traditional values that underpin modern societies.",
        "Sarker et al. (2019) note that 'humanistic concerns arising from the curtailing of human freedom and development, and from racism, sexism and commodification of the human body are overlooked for the apparent benefits that systems, including widely used search engines and medical databases, promise to deliver'. Indeed, there is a rising need for a thorough ethical interrogation of algorithms that underlie systems mediating many critical human activities, so as not to marginalize certain stakeholders, especially those 'who are already in the margin'.",
        "In this special issue, we take this critical, yet constructive view of technological and social changes associated with 'digital transformation'. We are interested in contrarian papers that reject the taken-for-granted assumptions of positive impacts of technology, as in cases of digital platforms, telework enabled by mobility, growth of the gig economy, fin-tech/blockchain, and so on, and investigate relatively unexamined platform externalities as a means to identify ways to resolve paradoxes, discontinuities, and challenges posed by technology and the unintended consequences of technology applications.",
        "We also seek papers that shed light on the problems of information technology (IT)-enabled phenomena such as the implications of winner-takes-all platform economics; highlight the social, environmental, and economic implications of blockchain and similar innovative digital technologies; or propose solutions that mitigate negative societal impacts of innovation (e.g., through leveraging the power social networks to disseminate information and strengthen democratic discourse).",
        "We encourage the submission of manuscripts taking either of two stances:",
        "1) Submissions considering a critical or dystopian view of the social, technological, and moral implications of digitization and digital transformation. Here, 'the dark side' – ethical issues, unintended digitalization, and other problematic aspects – of digitalization and platformization are front and centre the argument. An example may be Zuboff’s recent work on surveillance capitalism and her analyses of large-scale digitization 'gone wrong'.",
        "2) Submissions seeking to balance or reconcile 'the dark side' and 'the bright side' of digitalization and platformization. Here, analyses, exemplars, and theoretical frameworks considered ethical issues and negative consequences explicitly, in addition to intended benefits of digitalization too often exclusively focused on. An example may be social media research: initial writings trumpeted the benefits of social media for building relationships, with later work highlighting problematic behaviours such as cyberbullying or doxxing.",
        "In this special issue, we are open to all forms of inquiry, including surveys, experiments, case studies, design science projects, and conceptual work that probe 'the dark side', ethical issues, and unintended consequences of digitization, platformization, and the rapid diffusion of digital infrastructures and digital work models based thereon."

        "Theorizing is one of the defining aspects of academic research. Articulating insights generated from situated empirical observations into relatively stable abstractions (e.g., concepts, propositions, models) that elucidate, explain or predict events occurring at another time and place is the hallmark of knowledge generation (King 2021). Of late, much attention has been paid to theory development in the Information Systems (IS) field. For example, the MIS Quarterly (MISQ) special issue on 'Next-Generation Information Systems Theorizing' reflects a sense of urgency felt within the IS field to make sense of an increasingly unruly and complex reality given the increasing pace of technological innovation (Burton-Jones et al. 2021).",
        "New and native IS theories ensure that the IS field remains vibrant, diverse, academically and socially relevant and influential (Hassan 2011; Hassan and Willcocks 2021; Lowry et al. 2020; Markus and Saunders 2007). Researchers, however, often set the bar too high for theory delivered within individual research contributions by viewing theory as a comprehensive and detailed explanation of a phenomenon (Rivard 2021), an object that Weick (1995) refers to as a 'theory that sweeps away all others'. This mindset may lead IS researchers to adopt theories from other fields as a foundation rather than creatively developing new and native theories from empirical observations (Grover and Lyytinen 2015).",
        "To maintain the long-term growth and vitality of the IS field, a definition of theory that encourages cumulative and novel theorizing over time is needed (Hassan and Willcocks 2021; King 2021). One way of achieving this is by advancing a 'products of theorizing' perspective (Weick 1995). The theorizing perspective celebrates both the final outcomes and the 'interim struggles' that characterize theory generation. It holds the promise that interim conceptual artifacts of theorizing such as metaphors, frameworks and concepts (Lowry et al. 2020) are valuable to the discipline as they can be leveraged and exploited further in subsequent research. In this way, a discipline might inch its way towards native theories over time.",
        "The goal of this special issue is to solicit and showcase exemplars from the 'products of theorizing' approach. We are looking for articles that go beyond verification dimensions of the natural-science approach to IS research (Schlagwein 2021) and push the envelope of theorizing towards native products of theorizing. The time is ripe to embark upon the development of native theories in the IS field, as IT has leaped into the consciousness of the public in unprecedented ways. Big data and AI applications are part of consumers' and workers' everyday lives, either enhancing them or increasing their visibility (Aral 2020; Benbya et al. 2021; Zuboff 2019); firms increasingly deploy robotic process automation and cognitive automation, aiming to achieve benefits for themselves, their employees and their customers (Lacity and Willcocks 2021); and governments rely on new forms of data collection about citizens in support of the services they provide (Kolas et al. 2021).",
        "To take advantage of the theorizing opportunities that these emergent IT phenomena provide, the goal of this special issue is to encourage research that generates products of theorizing derived from and related to IT phenomena. We are seeking contributions that develop products of theorizing, that is, interim constructions, that are useful as precursors to strong native IS theory. To increase the likelihood of a theorizing product's value, we are particularly interested in research that tackles phenomena that are core to the IS discipline. Given the multifaceted nature of the IS discipline, we do not expect agreement on what constitutes a core IS phenomenon. We therefore encourage authors to make the case that the products of theorizing they develop are valuable for articulating native theories that are defining of the field of IS or are substantially valuable for their specific area."

        "The literature on digital transformation is interdisciplinary, spanning fields such as information systems, management and other business disciplines. However, this work's broad range and somewhat incoherent framings show a lack of consensus of \"digital transformation\" as both a theoretical concept and an empirical field. Thus far, most digital transformation studies have focused on the organization as the unit of analysis. Why a single definition of digital transformation may be elusive, the digital transformation seems most often used to as just a shorthand for IT-enabled organizational transformation, an organization-centric approach.",

Digital transformation(s) hence often have disruptive effects in relation to industry structures, corporate strategy, consumer experiences, policies and overall economic and societal trajectories.",

        "We are interested in work that understands digital transformation as a process. Studies of interest may use process theories, process analyses and/or process data to provide explanations. Process studies offer a means of conceptualizing events and identifying patterns. These aspects have often been neglected in IS studies in favour of simplistic variance models. Approaching digital transformation fundamentally as a process promises to produce theoretical accounts with nuanced explanations of change. Variance models (and other types of models) are also welcomed to the special issue. Still, they will be expected to pay attention to digital transformation as a process and not to neglect the relevant processual patterns or temporal order.",
        "We are interested in work that studies digital transformation in a broad sense. Such work may see digital transformation as a nexus of technological, organizational, industrial, economic, governmental, societal and geo-political changes. This nexus invites theoretical and empirical studies which extend organization-centric views to understanding wider processes in which digital IT plays a key role. Emerging IT may generate specific opportunities for such research. Digital transformations come with significant challenges for businesses and societies, governments, and regulators across jurisdictions. Organization-centric approaches are welcomed to the special issue but must pay attention to wider developments and contexts and argue why the organization is the best locus of study.",
        "In preparing papers for this special issue, authors are expected to engage with the concept of digital transformation as a process and provide critical theoretical and/or empirical analysis extending beyond IT-driven change of isolated business processes."

        "This special issue is interested in 'next - generation' research methods for studying information technology (IT) phenomena – particularly in the information system (IS) research field. So far, IS researchers have applied a range of quantitative, qualitative and engaged methods to study IT - related phenomena. Quantitative IS research has often followed a positivist approach of hypothesis testing, with sometimes 'first - generation' regression models distinguished from 'second - generation' structural equation models (Gerow et al. 2011). Data used in such methods stems from surveys, experiments, panel studies, etc. The primary objective of this research stream typically is theory testing. Qualitative IS research has ranged from positivist to interpretivist, seeking rich situated insights via case studies, grounded theory or ethnographies. One objective of this research stream is theory construction. Critical and emancipatory IS research adds a strong value orientation and theoretical basis to qualitative research. Another type of IS research seeks to generate new knowledge with 'engaged' methods like design science or action research. The objective of this stream that differentiates it from the first two is the focus on solving important individual, organizational or societal challenges; or extending the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts (Baskerville and Wood - Harper 1996; Hevner et al. 2004). In recent years, the scope of and possibilities for IS research have tremendously widened. Digital IT have become mainstream at the individual, organizational and societal levels (Burton - Jones et al. 2021). Digital IT is key to innovation in various domains from medicine to education, from psychology to the arts. Hence, these domains have become of interest and relevance to IS researchers, yet also overlap with other fields and are hence interdisciplinary in nature. These innovations are increasing the volume and variety of trace data available to researchers but necessitate a shift in our research practices (Johnson et al. 2019). Further, big data, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide a plethora of powerful approaches for collecting and analysing data at a scale not possible before such that we might need to adapt our research methods and tools to make this data actionable and to generate novel knowledge. These ML technologies are being applied not only to theory testing but also to theory construction – in conjunction with or independent of qualitative methods (Miranda et al. 2022). This special issue focuses on the next generation of research methods to study IT – new methods relevant to the IS research field that account for a) the interdisciplinary nature and wider scope of IT phenomena, and/or b) the novel capacities afforded by new technologies/techniques (e.g., ML/AI). The way that novel technologies and techniques afford new possibilities is quite apparent in quantitative IS research. In contrast to 'first - generation' regression - based approaches and 'second - generation' structural equation modelling, a new generation of research methods including the predictive analytics (Shmueli and Koppius 2011), data mining (Smith 2020), ML (Shrestha et al. 2020) or explainable AI (Gunning et al. 2019) come with substantial new opportunities and challenges. For instance, these methods potentially allow for more fine - grained measurements and analyses to extend our knowledge of existing phenomena and may help us study novel phenomena including those that were, methodologically speaking, 'out of reach' (George et al. 2016). These technological advancements enable us to progress our research toolkit and inform new ways of generating knowledge and theorizing (Burton - Jones et al. 2021; Shrestha et al. 2020). Increased recognition of abduction as a counterpart to deductive and inductive reasoning (Behfar and Okhuysen 2018; Sætre and Van de Ven 2021) pits concerns about practices such as HARKing (Kerr 1998) – hypothesizing after the results are known (aka p - hacking) – believed to lead to logically and scientifically flawed hypotheses, against concerns about stifling the advancement of knowledge (Pratt et al. 2019). ML/AI techniques are now so powerful that they can test millions of models on large data sets to find the 'best - matching' model (of all possible) for what needs to be explained. This is a fundamental gear change in what can be done with quantitative data sets, the promise and validity of which are hotly debated (Kitchin 2014; Smith 2020). In terms of changes to the nature of the IS domains, qualitative - interpretative researchers seek to find new methods suitable for the wider, interdisciplinary scope of IS research. This is done via finding or developing analytical new grounds and looking at digital IT differently (e.g. via sociomaterial or affordances perspectives), seeking additional foundations in other fields (e.g., Zuboff’s (2015) political economy informed analysis of surveillance capitalism and 'Big Tech') or via the modification of methods to suit digital environments (e.g., virtual ethnographies or computational grounded theory). Other forms of qualitative research such as meta - synthesis, qualitative comparative analysis and discourse analysis also seem promising and relevant but are seldomly used in IS research. Digital IT (e.g., social media, digital platforms, AI/ML) has increasing and substantial impacts on society (e.g., mental health, trust in science, misinformation and polarization, monopolization and industry disruption). Hence, ethical, critical, value - based and political - economy questions are increasingly and necessarily asked about digital IT. Similarly, today's pace of innovation may also warrant novel approaches to engaged scholarship and design science. For instance, researchers are calling for methods that can accumulate and update evidence more effectively (Lacity et al. 2021) and better ensure the generalizability of prescriptive knowledge (Brendel et al. 2021; Iivari et al. 2021). This special issue invites contributions that propose, introduce, debate or critique novel quantitative, qualitative or design - oriented methods research, with a focus on the 'how' (i.e., origins, processes, steps of the method) and the 'why' (e.g., 'rigour vs relevance' and 'it is new, but is it better' questions) these approaches should be used in IS research. The goal of the special issue is to provide a space for introducing and discussing innovative 'next - generation' methods for studying IT - related phenomena, relative to the IS research field."

        "This special issue seeks to explore and extend the conceptualisation, design, development, implementation and governance of contemporary “decentralised” information systems. “Decentralised” information systems are often seen as an important anti-thesis to “centralised” such systems. Modern societies and economies rely more highly on data, information systems, and technologies than ever. Pioneering organisations brought forth major milestones in developing and providing information technologies (e.g., TCP/IP and the Internet). However, with the significance of information technology increasing over the past decades, a small number of organisations have emerged as “tech giants” (e.g., Alphabet/Google or Meta/Facebook) (Zuboff 2015). Those organisations offer digital services and infrastructures for data processing that gained large-scale adoption by individuals, organisations, governments and society at large. As a result, societies, economies and technical systems became strongly dependent on services from a handful of organisations. The increase of the resulting dependencies leads to a centralisation of information systems. Highly-centralised information systems can result in global organisations and central social actors that abuse their power and pursue their own interests at the expense of others (e.g., by manipulation; Granville 2018), exclude participation from social actors who disagree with them (e.g., by censorship; Zittrain et al. 2017) or invade their privacy through monitoring (e.g., by tracking actions of individuals on the internet; Zuboff 2019). Highly-centralised information systems can also pose several further risks. For example, governance rights – such as rights of access, validation, software updates, data policies, and data overrides — may be centralised with few social actors in control. From a technical perspective, successful attacks on and crashes of central computing devices for network message propagation can interrupt communication in computing systems and even bring about system failures. To avert risks of over-centralization, the purposeful decentralisation of information systems has become a prominent topic of public discourse, for example, around Internet search (e.g., Lobanova 2021; Lomas 2019), cloud computing (e.g., Balanagu 2022; Gaia - X European Association for Data and Cloud AISBL 2023), social media (e.g., Patel 2023; Smith 2023) and financial systems (e.g., Eric Lipton and Ephrat Livni 2022; Wintermeyer 2020). An information system’s degree of decentralisation refers to the degree to which the information system is independent of central actors and technical constructs (Kannengießer et al. 2020; Sunyaev et al. 2021). Several attempts have been made to design decentralised information systems to improve collaboration between actors while reducing dependencies on central authorities. Such endeavours include the development of decentralised token economies based on distributed ledger technology (Sunyaev et al. 2021), decentralised identity management systems (Lacity et al. forthcoming; Lacity and Carmel 2022; Stockburger et al. 2021) and distributed collaborative machine learning systems (e.g., federated learning systems; Rieke et al. 2020).",
        "Although information systems decentralisation may resolve several of the above issues of over-centralization, it also comes with its own challenges. For example, maintaining decentralised information systems can become difficult when multiple social actors need to update their technical components independently (Kannengießer et al. 2020). Extensive data replication across technical components in decentralised information systems (e.g., in blockchain systems) can facilitate detecting and exploiting software vulnerabilities (Kannengießer et al. 2021). If too many social actors have opposing ideas, decentralised governance risks never reaching an agreement (Lacity and Lupien 2022; Pfister et al. 2022). When only a few social actors participate in governance, information systems envisioned to be decentralised may de facto centralise. To purposefully achieve the benefits of information system decentralisation, we need to consider both the design of information systems as such and the behaviour of the social actors involved (De Filippi and Loveluck 2016; Pfister et al. 2022). Information systems decentralisation is driven by interdepended economic, political, social and technical factors. As an example of technical factors, the innovation of blockchain technology supports the decentralisation of asset ownership management (Sunyaev et al. 2021). Changes to corporate information system designs, corporate ecosystems, and regulatory refinements are required to facilitate the development and adoption of such technical innovations. Such changes can lead to the centralisation of information systems in other aspects, such as their organisational structures. The entanglement of interdisciplinary factors tightly makes information systems decentralisation an interdisciplinary topic, relevant to several research fields, including computer science (e.g., Miller et al. 2016), organisational studies (e.g., Siggelkow and Levinthal 2003) and information systems (e.g., De Filippi and Loveluck 2016). The interdependence between information system designs and the influence of interdisciplinary factors makes the purposeful decentralisation of information systems an important yet complex undertaking that this special issue seeks new knowledge about. The complexity of information system decentralisation leads to various open questions, such as “how to achieve and sustain appropriate degrees of decentralisation of information systems so that individuals, organisations, and entire business ecosystems can benefit”, “how decentralised enterprise information systems need to be designed”, and “what technical know-how and involvement is required from actors to decentralise information systems appropriately”.",
        "This special issue seeks to improve the understanding of how the various factors affect the decentralisation of information systems used in business and other societal contexts, how different degrees of decentralisation of such information systems emerge over time, and how different degrees of decentralisation of information systems can affect business ecosystems, business processes, and societies overall. We invite applied, empirical, and theoretical research works that investigate information system decentralisation in a way that acknowledges its inter-disciplinary nature and significantly contributes to understanding information system decentralisation, its manifestations, antecedents, and its impact on individuals and organisations, ecosystems and societies. We welcome and encourage submissions from researchers using diverse epistemological and methodological approaches. The manuscripts will be evaluated for the interestingness and novelty of their contributions."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Creativity is typically defined as the capacity to produce something – either abstract or physical -- that is (1) new; and (2) valuable. Recent rapid advances in generative models such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, which is capable of generating unlimited new output (e.g., writing, image) that are arguably indistinguishable from human creative output, have surprised many. This new class of technology is also energizing the scholarly interest in creativity.",
        "Kaufman and Beghetto (2009) proposed a Four C model for creativity, mini-c (transformative learning), little-c (everyday creativity), Pro-c (professional expertise), and Big-C (eminent creative contributions). While human creativity has led to tremendous progress in science, technology, and society, the performance of creativity is nevertheless treated as a black box by both academics and practitioners. We know about environments and activities that are conducive to creative tasks – ranging from brainstorming to going for a run -- but we do not know precisely how human creativity works. This makes it challenging to enact it reliably and at scale.",
        "But algorithmic creativity performed by generative large language models such as Chat GPT and other AI applications is just as impenetrable. While these algorithms can produce exceptional new ideas and outputs (e.g., the Dreamcatcher chair), their designers (e.g., OpenAI) do not fully understand how these models work.",
        "Nevertheless, recent advances in neuroscience and computer science point to a form of creativity – namely analytical creativity – that can potentially yield creative outcomes in a replicable manner. Analytical creativity conceptualizes the creative task as a search problem whose purpose is to find the most desirable outcome, which is defined in terms of newness/originality and value, within a vast theoretical space, and to do so optimally (low search cost). Its goal is to uncover the process behind human or machine creativity. Using an analogy: the traditional conception of creativity is similar to a magician’s performance as viewed from the audience’s perspective. To the average viewer, the acts are beyond explanation and thus magical. But in reality, every magician’s performance is achieved by following a carefully designed recipe of action, which include slights of hand that capitalize on human’s perceptual weaknesses.",
        "What if creativity is not so much a stroke of genius or ‘divine inspiration,’ but a rather mundane process that, once understood, can be automated? Evidence is mounting that this might indeed be the case. Using brain image and computational models, neuroscience provides a more structured understanding of how our brains process a creative task in a systematic way. Recent developments in deep learning research have led to interpretable models that can identify new game-playing strategies, generate visual art, and compose songs (e.g., large language models).",
        "Such deep learning models are beginning to unmask the complex steps involved in human creativity. For example, the process of how protein folds, which is a significant component of how the creative process is performed by the brain, has been broken down into 3D structures (Eisenstein 2021). Together with the research on neuroscience, this evidence has coalesced into a stream of creativity research that posits that the creative process shares commonality across domains, and that it can be learned, practiced, and performed with consistent results. Examples of this stream of research on analytical creativity include Altshuller’s (1984) theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) and Ding’s (2020) logical creativity theory.",
        "Analytical creativity is a more general concept than computational creativity, an emerging multidisciplinary domain that seeks to 'model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends: construct a program or computer capable of human-level creativity to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans; to design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves.",
        "This special issue seeks to encourage research that questions, evaluates, and advances analytical creativity. We welcome philosophical, theoretical, empirical, and design-science contributions. We encourage multi-disciplinary studies that integrate fields such as information systems, management/organization science, computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, and mathematics, as well as psychology and sociology."

        "“The influence of the liberty of the press does not affect political opinions alone, but it extends to all the opinions of men, and it modifies customs as well as laws.” (De Tocqueville, 1864, p. 230)",
        "Over the last 20 years, ongoing waves of digitalization have decimated the traditional business model of the news and fundamentally changed how the news, or more formally, the ‘institutional press’, works. Indeed, ever since reserved frequencies were gifted to television broadcasters in the 1950s, on the condition that they inform the public of current events, the subsidy underpinning newspapers and other forms of institutional media has slowly eroded. Like many other industries, the internet has accelerated this phenomenon. Not only has the hyper-targeted advertising facilitated by social media and other platforms functionally eroded the subsidy model to its breaking point (Anderson et al., 2015; Angelucci & Cagé, 2019; Gentzkow, 2014; Seamans & Zhu, 2013); but the costless transmission of data facilitated by the internet has increased geographic scope of dominant players (e.g. The New York Times), permitting them to reach beyond their original markets and squeeze content producers across the globe (Brock, 2013; George & Waldfogel, 2006). Against this backdrop, it is hard to overstate the importance of this “crisis of the institutional press” (Reese, 2020). The news provides our primary means for understanding the world around us. Societies desperately need a well-functioning institutional press to tackle the many societal, economic, and environmental challenges we all face.",
        "The first day of core MIS undergraduate or MS/MBA classes usually begins with one of four motivating examples: the decline of incumbent sellers (e.g. Blockbuster Video, malls, taxis) in favor of digital platforms (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, Uber), the increasing irrelevance of diseconomies of scale and the rise of digital monopolies (e.g. Google, Microsoft), the rise of social media and user generated content (viz. Web 2.0 and 3.0), or the decline of the newspaper industry. Yet, as these classes continue to discuss the opportunities firms have in the digital age (seamlessly changing prices, directly engaging with consumers via social media), and teach students to implement advanced analytics to more effectively mine business value from data, the decline of institutional media often fades into the background.",
        "This phenomenon-driven special issue is motivated by the view that our students, colleagues, and society urgently need a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the changing nature of news in the digital era and potential solutions going forward. The special issue takes an interdisciplinary perspective, bringing together insights from across the broader information, managerial, and organizational sciences.",
        "This failure to discuss the implications of the decline of institutional news media is troubling. Not only has the Fourth Estate historically served to counterbalance institutions with a monopoly on force and morality (e.g., the state and church), it has been a cornerstone of democratic republics for centuries. In 17th Century England, the philosopher John Locke railed against the Licensing and Press Act of 1662, claiming that “gagging a man, for fear he should talk heresy or sedition, has no other ground than such as will make chains necessary.” In the United States, James Madison declared the free press as “the only effectual guardian of every other right.” In the balance, Western Marxists criticized the singular power of institutional media, seeing it as an instrument for ideological control (Marcuse, 1964).",
        "These claims are not idle musings. News media outlets have been shown to influence many societal outcomes, from government agendas (Edwards & Wood, 1999; Walgrave et al., 2008), to public opinion (Gamson & Modigliani, 1989), to voting behavior (Druckman, 2005). The Fourth Estate mediates the attention granted to social movements (Andrews & Caren, 2010) and can influence the strategic management of organizations (Bednar, 2012; Bednar et al., 2013). Institutional media can also prompt changes in corporate governance (Dyck et al., 2008): it can shape the valuation of firms at IPO (Pollock et al., 2008), influence firm founding (Greenwood & Gopal, 2015), confer legitimacy on industries (Zilber, 2006), and even elevate de novo technological innovations in the public consciousness (Miranda et al., 2022; Wang & Swanson, 2008).",
        "Yet, seismic changes have assaulted the free press as we understand it. The late 20th century witnessed an increasing concentration in ownership of news outlets, leading to elevated reliance on advertising revenue that biased content (Gilens & Hertzman, 2000; Herman & Chomsky, 1988; Lazarsfeld & Merton, 2000). The recent history of the institutional press is interwoven with the history of digital technology. Initially, the World Wide Web served largely as a vehicle for the dissemination of news produced by professional news organizations, extending their reach (George & Waldfogel, 2006; Shoemaker & Reese, 1996). In time, the ensuing competition for reader attention shifted the gatekeeping function previously served by professional news organizations to portals – or online content curators (Hargittai, 2000). Contemporary media coverage became more selective (Oliver & Maney, 2000) and influenced by market actors (Ahern & Sosyura, 2014; Bail, 2012). With the advent of social media, user-generated content further usurped the gatekeeping role of professional news organizations, specifically that of their journalists whose work was governed by professional norms and practices (Reese, 2020). Moreover, public subsidy for the Fourth Estate was undermined by social media (Seamans & Zhu, 2014), accelerating the control of dominant players like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on public discourse (George & Waldfogel, 2006). In turn, this hollowed the local publishing industry, subverting attention to local political issues (i.e. nationalizing politics (Trussler, 2021)) and increasing economic agents’ willingness to contravene state and federal law (Matherly & Greenwood, 2022). At the same time, social media has afforded citizen journalists the ability to counter-balance the biases of professional news organizations. For example, the interests of the populace were pitted against those of media organizations with the legislative proposal of the Stop Online Piracy bill (Miranda et al., 2016).",
        "Even more recently, society has witnessed a demonstrable shift towards the “post-truth era,” in which populist, tribalist, and anti- “mainstream media” rhetoric proliferates. Indeed, scholarship suggests that such rhetoric serves to further undermine public confidence in the institutional press, pushing large portions of the populace towards alternate media that eschew journalistic norms and evidence-based reporting (Reese, 2020). While the blockchain has been heralded as a way of remaking the institutional press in the digital era (Ivancsics, 2019), we have little systematic understanding of its efficacy. All the while, the process of news construction and dissemination is being disrupted by algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (Diakopoulos, 2019). The long-term implications of these AI tools (e.g., Reuters’ Lynx Insights) on the institutional press are unknown (Kobie, 2018). Indeed, we are witnessing intersections of the evolutionary paths of technology and the institutional press in ways that are fundamentally changing the “freedom of the press” and the complex network that includes journalists, software engineers, relational databases, and social media platforms which form it; along with prevailing norms, values, and institutional logics of a particular sociotechnical moment (Ananny, 2018).",
        "Research has only begun to address these changes. A cursory evaluation of premiere information systems and management outlets reveals a dearth of research which directly engages with the changing nature of the institutional press (Aral & Dhillon, 2021; Clemons et al., 2002; Greenwood & Gopal, 2015; Kitchens et al., 2020; Seamans & Zhu, 2014; Venkatesan et al., 2021). The purpose of this Special Issue is to address this gap in scholarship head on and to inform stakeholders such as media managers, social planners, legislators, trade associations, regulators, and journalists about how changes in institutional media are affecting society at the intersection of business, technology, and public policy. To this end, we invite scholarship that helps academia and society (1) comprehend the major changes taking place within the institutional press, why those changes are occurring, and what the consequences of those changes are; and (2) work together toward a more positive future for the institutional press.",
        "Few problems of today epitomize the intersection of the technological and the institutional (Barley & Orlikowski, 2023) as the modern day Fourth Estate. To encourage the necessary scholarship on the challenges and opportunities facing it, we have assembled an interdisciplinary research team of scholars across diverse theoretical and methodological paradigms. We encourage an equally diverse breadth of scholars to submit their work to this special issue."

        "In the spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the operations of most companies worldwide to move online. The education systems along with several other services for citizens, including public administration, healthcare etc. followed suit (Marabelli et al. 2021). In a sense, the COVID-19 pandemic served as an unintended natural experiment, testing the extent to which current technologies are able to support remote/virtual interactions via immersive platforms. At the same time, the pandemic also exposed limitations of these arrangements, setting the groundwork for novel ways (and technologies) to promote further such interactions in the future.",
        "Most knowledge workers were already used to working remotely, at least occasionally, working from home, in virtual teams and on-line communities. Engagement in on-line meetings for prolonged periods of time, and sometimes overnight, was a disruptive change that left knowledge workers longing for a return to more in-person interactions. In healthcare, telecare was seldom used before the pandemic. Yet, when regular in-person visits became impossible, the industry adapted to the new realities and, as an example, in the US in 2021, telehealth services had been used 38 times more often than before the start of the pandemic (Marr 2022). Since then, most in-person healthcare operations have resumed. Similarly in the education sector, primary and secondary schools resumed in-person classes in most countries (China being a partial exception), as vaccines became available, and the effects of the pandemic faded. Higher education institutions, however, behaved differently. The already diffused offering of remote classes and curricula saw the pandemic as an opportunity to consolidate the on-line education industry, a development that is most likely here to stay (Lockee 2021). Looking at higher education from a researcher perspective, on-line meetings are certainly more common in the aftermath of the pandemic, along with conferences and workshops often being run in hybrid mode, albeit with mixed results (Marabelli et al. 2023).",
        "In sum, COVID-19 forced several industries to systematically adopt technologies and practices to work, interact and collaborate remotely. The pandemic also gave high-tech companies the push to develop new systems supporting on-line interactions in a supposedly more effective fashion. For instance, Meta, in 2021, had already invested over $10B in metaverse-related projects (Brown 2021). In January 2022, Microsoft invested $68.7B in the metaverse by acquiring Activision Blizzard Inc. (Nasdaq: ATVI), a gaming and virtual reality company (Microsoft 2022). According to Matthew Ball’s (2021) definition, the metaverse is “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.” The metaverse is different from other collaborative platforms because of its immersiveness, meaning that the 3D technical features, along with the use of avatars and devices such as headsets and other types of sensors, make users sense that they are in a place in which they are not (i.e., the office, the doctor’s office, or a vacation resort). These sociotechnical systems represent a break from the mainstream. Along with the metaverse, other initiatives aimed at making up for the lack of immersive experience of traditional technologies for synchronous remote collaborations, such as Zoom, are surfacing. Examples include Apple’s augmented and mixed reality. While employing different devices, marketing approaches and strategies, they all represent sociotechnical systems aimed at overcoming the 2D limitations of current collaborative technologies. Yet, it remains to be seen whether they will actually be able to fill the gap between in-person and on-line interactions by providing immersive user experience. And, if so, at what cost?",
        "Marabelli and Newell (2023), in a recent JSIS opinion paper, fleshed out several strategic opportunities and challenges of the future of on-line interactions, focusing on DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) issues, and on the metaverse. In this call for papers, we seek manuscripts that explore the future of work with respect to immersive platforms enabling innovative work practices and ask perspective authors specifically to consider the potential pitfalls (i.e., concerning ethics and DEI) of all this.",
        "For instance, concerning remote working, on-line data on interactions are often harvested by analytics systems, as employee performance is assessed by automated systems such as AI. Such surveillance leaves certain segments susceptible to unfair assessment such as people with disabilities (who might not be able to access immersive platforms), women (notably less prone to speak up in on-line interactions ) and unfair treatment of non-White people (for instance, when technologies involve facial recognition systems to enter buildings and in accessing organizational resources). A further discriminatory factor concerns those excluded from remote work, such as some task workers (bus drivers, grocery store cashiers, carpenters, etc.) for whom it is impossible to perform their jobs remotely, and who often include disadvantaged people and people at the margin.",
        "In healthcare, remotization might lead to unequal access to care, especially if telehealth becomes immersive, with remote patients required to wear devices (e.g., bodysuits) allowing clinicians to capture vitals. These devices are expensive and, for a long time, will not be available for everyone. For instance, it is foreseeable that in the US (a private/public healthcare system where private health is prevalent and very expensive), only people with private health insurance will be able to access immersive remote care. In addition, while telehealth is supposed to reach populations in rural areas and minimize travel for the elderly and people with limited mobility, remote immersive care requires broadband, which might be unavailable in these areas.",
        "Higher education is prone to exclusions similar to those present in healthcare settings, with potential discriminations against financially weak students, students living in rural areas, students with disabilities etc. If the focus is shifted from students to professors, along with the aforementioned issues related to remote work, academics are and will be challenged by attending conferences in hybrid mode. On the one hand, expensive equipment to “attend” remotely using virtual reality may lead to the exclusion of people from under-represented regions and universities lacking resources for example. These issues will make it difficult to use hybrid techniques to include participants from the Global South (even though it might allow the participation of people who otherwise might not be able to travel, such as pregnant women). On the other hand, hybrid conferences might lead to a two-tier system of first and second class citizens, with the former enjoying social events after paper sessions, with the latter simply logging off (cf. Marabelli et al. 2023). In a debate on hybrid conferences, Ahuja (2023, Forthcoming), discusses the role of hybrid and on-line conferences in developing a sense of belonging (to the AIS community), as experienced by members of different regions. It is certainly possible that hybrid conferences intended to enhance diversity (allowing more participation from underrepresented regions for instance) end up being detrimental to inclusion. We thus invite theorizing on whether the constructs of diversity and inclusion should be decoupled in certain settings.",
        "We have discussed remote work, healthcare and higher education as but three examples of the unequal impact that novel technologies, involving virtual, augmented and mixed reality, may involve. Other examples include the use of these technologies by law enforcement, which might collect user behavior data on such platforms and draw conclusions on what individuals could do in off-line settings – leading to predictive policing not based on data about crimes and neighborhoods but instead on inferences on behavioral data happening in virtual environments enabled by immersive platforms. We welcome papers discussing remotization – and its dark side – in the above mentioned settings and more.",
        "Importantly, along with the problems associated with remotization, authors should be able to point to solutions that are strategic for companies. While it is an obligation for every company to uphold ethical standards, thereby preventing discrimination, promoting inclusion and fairness (i.e., DEI), often company ethical standards coincide with the requirements of the law. It is therefore strategic for companies (and organizations more generally) to use novel immersive platforms in a responsible manner, for ethical as well as compliance reasons. Laws and regulations on privacy (cf. GDPR in Europe and PIPL in China) and the use of algorithmic-based systems (cf. AI Act in Europe), demand strategic actions aimed at ensuring the respect of current laws, also considering the international breadth of these laws and the global competitive environment in which we live. To this end, papers specifically tackling subjects concerning coercive forces, under the umbrella of institutional theories, are very welcome.",
        "Another important point to consider is that of the environmental impact associated with the intense use of virtual realities in various settings of the workplace. The need for computational capabilities and storage will require heavy use of electricity (and cooling systems), which will contribute to the global warming. Yet, global warming has uneven consequences across populations. For instance, India (nearly 18% of the world population), generates 3% of the world pollution but pays a high price because of global warming, with temperatures having risen to 110F in June and July 2022 (Williams 2022). These and other issues – and associated potential for theorizing – are summarized by Marabelli and Newell (2023). We look for papers that either build on these issues or go beyond, given the broad landscape of industries and settings that are and will be affected by remotization, with a particular focus on emerging technologies related to virtual, augmented, and mixed reality enabled by immersive platforms.",
        "Overall, we welcome empirical, theoretical, review and perspective/position papers. While we are inclined to recommend that papers with empirical data are preferred, we understand that we are discussing a phenomenon in its becoming. Yet, papers with primary data or those that systematically analyze secondary data on organizations using novel technologies for remotization are strongly encouraged. JSIS, while specific in its focus on strategy and strategizing (cf. Gable 2020) is inclusive as to the use of methods of any kind. Qualitative, quantitative, archival/historical analyses, mixed method papers, and experiments are all welcome, as long as rigor leads the collection of data (if applicable) and its analysis. Importantly, conclusions, critical reflections and impacts should result. Strong theoretical contributions are required for empirical and theoretical papers. Perspective/position papers should also contribute to theory, by developing a research agenda, with implications for practice also being highlighted. We will give priority to empirical, theoretical and review submissions, and encourage authors planning to submit a perspective/position paper to contact us directly, prior to submitting their work."

        "Sustainability is a moral and existential imperative of our time. As Information Systems (IS) scholars, we are aware of the immense impact of digital technologies on efforts and initiatives towards sustainable practice happening locally and globally. Furthermore, because digital phenomena lie at the heart of our discipline, IS researchers are well positioned to join these efforts. This Special Issue aims to champion new digital sustainability research programs targeting the planet’s most pressing sustainability challenges from the past decade. We hope it will contribute towards building novel collective knowledge and help shape digital sustainability research in IS.",
        "Human society is approaching the edge of a dangerous precipice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report unequivocally confirms that human activities have caused global warming, predicting that even with current commitments and mitigation efforts, it will be difficult to limit warming below the critical threshold of 2 °C (IPCC, 2023). The planet’s air, land, and water continue to be threatened on several fronts, with research suggesting that the safe operating zone for six of the nine planetary boundaries has already been breached (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.). Over the past decade, extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, fires, and heatwaves have not only increased in frequency but also in magnitude. In addition to causing environmental impacts, these events have a significant impact on society, further complicating the pursuit of social and economic sustainability. In 2020, about 724 million people were living in conditions of extreme poverty, with almost 30% of the world’s population suffering from some level of food insecurity (United Nations, 2023). Equality for women and other marginalized groups continues to lag. The World Bank (2022) reports that 2.4 billion women globally do not have the same economic rights as men, and despite the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 (United Nations, 2007), Indigenous Peoples around the world continue to suffer the intergenerational trauma of colonization. The trend towards urbanization endures, with cities struggling to ensure inclusive, resilient, and sustainable living environments for all residents (United Nations 2023). On top of all these challenges, violent conflicts have led to the forced migration of millions of people and the deaths of thousands of civilians (United Nations 2023). These alarming circumstances highlight the lack of progress towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. As stated in the 2023 Progress Report, the promise of leaving no one behind is in peril: of 140 measured targets, only 12% are on track for 2030, and about half are moderately or severely off track.",
        "In response to the urgent need to address sustainability challenges, organizations, governments, and industries worldwide have started to make efforts in recent years to harness the potential of digital technologies. Examples of such efforts range from specific solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors widely used by many organizations to pursue sustainability objectives, to the birth of new data-driven companies that are applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer sustainability-related data services. This harnessing of digital technologies to address sustainability challenges has impacted the way practitioners view this emerging trend, which they increasingly refer to as digital sustainability. For example, Gartner describes digital sustainability as harnessing the “tools of digital transformation, such as enhanced connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT), to improve the environment and support sustainable business operations”. On a global scale, the United Nations has initiated conversations on the relationship between digital sustainability and environmental concerns. For example, the focus of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is “accelerating and scaling environmental sustainability by applying data, digital technologies, and solutions to UNEP’s key activities, products, and services and ultimately delivers on its key action areas — climate, nature, and pollution” (UN Environment Programme, n.d.). In the domain of social sustainability, the United Nations chosen theme of “DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality” for International Women’s Day 2023 emphasizes the potential of digital technologies for empowering women and girls.",
        "However, IS research has been lagging behind the digital sustainability discourse happening in practice. As argued in a recent JAIS editorial on digital sustainability (Kotlarsky et al., 2023), the IS research community has a strong foundation to draw upon (Watson et al., 2020), ranging from research into Green IS (e.g., Leidner et al. 2022; Watson et al. 2021; Corbett & Mellouli, 2017) to studies addressing significant societal challenges (e.g., Tong et al. 2022; Young et. al. 2019; Young 2018; Tim et al. 2017, Puri 2007). As Urquhart and her colleagues (2008) note, the poor cannot eat technology, but the mindful design and use of technology can contribute to innovative solutions and positive impacts. In particular, we consider that the recent shift in the way IS research approaches digital phenomena offers new perspectives on the relationship between digital technologies and sustainability. Building on Baskerville et al.’s (2020) contention that the classical view of an information system as representing and reflecting physical reality has become obsolete, we agree that an ontological reversal has taken place at the junction between technology and sustainability whereby the digital version of business solutions is created first (e.g., algorithms and data analytics solutions) and the physical version second (e.g., material waste) (Kotlarsky et al. 2023). As a result, the assumption that IS only represents the physical assets within sustainability phenomena is being challenged. This provides an opportunity for the IS community to drive a more inclusive agenda on digital sustainability, one that encompasses phenomena in which the impact of digital technologies and macro-level environmental, social, and economic objectives converge. Accordingly, this Special Issue seeks contributions that delve into digital sustainability and encompass 'the development, deployment, and utilization of digital resources and artifacts toward improving the environment, society, and economic welfare' (Kotlarsky et al. 2023, p. 938).",
        "We invite original and thought-provoking studies that advance and shape our understanding of digital sustainability as an emerging research area. We are interested in studies that contribute to our understanding of environmental and/or social sustainability, and studies that elucidate new forms of digital sustainability. We therefore welcome studies that engage with digital sustainability by building on theoretical foundations from the extant IS literature, as well as studies that bring insights from other disciplines into the IS research domain. Furthermore, we seek studies that consider digital sustainability at all levels and perspectives, in the context of developing and developed nations. We specifically welcome submissions that integrate more than one dimension of digital sustainability — the environment, society, and/or economic welfare. Overall, we aim to present a collection of papers that provides a balanced, integrated, and cumulative perspective on digital sustainability. Potential topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Design and development considerations, Use considerations, Management and governance considerations, Outcomes and consequences."

        "The origins of generative AI (GAI) can be traced back to the 1950s, when Alan Turing proposed a test to determine whether a machine could be perceived as intelligent enough to generate responses to questions in a way indistinguishable from a human. Later, in the 1970s, researchers developed more advanced models capable of producing more realistic and coherent outcomes.",
        "Contemporary GAI models are based on state-of-the-art neural network architectures. They combine such architectures to develop large models (e.g., Large Language Models, or LLMs) that outperform existing benchmarked ones. Contemporary GAI solutions can produce large amounts of contextual outputs on any specific topic. They are highly trained and sophisticated, enabling users to produce various types of AI-generated content.",
        "Although GAI has been around for a while, recent developments have brought the potential of such solutions to the forefront. In particular, LLMs have the potential to transform the way we develop textual content and communicate with one another. Hence, the latest developments in GAI have increased its potential for use in a wide range of industries like healthcare, customer service, media, marketing, finance, biopharma among others.",
        "The ongoing discourse on GAI seems to extol the promises of AI (utopian visions of a world free of drudgery and want) and the dangers (dystopian visions of machines taking over the world). Such discourse is well chronicled for many technologies in the Gartner hype cycle.",
        "Our goal for this Special Issue is to offer a careful examination of the challenges faced in managing this powerful set of technologies for individuals, organizations, and society. Many challenges around GAI concern data. As per a Forbes report, over 90% of internet data will be produced by GAI models, triggering serious concerns about harmful and abusive content generation.",
        "To illustrate the challenge, most current GAI-triggered use involves chat-based digital assistants. While the outcome of GAI in these digital assistant-based applications is indeed remarkable, their effectiveness depends on the level of task specificity and the need for information synthesis. Organizations and governments face challenges associated with policies of data protection and content moderation."

        "To be considered for this special issue, an extended abstract must be submitted via the JAIS Manuscript Central submission system by February 1, 2023 (please specify “Health Analytics and IS Theorizing” special issue in the cover letter when submitting). The abstract must be 5-pages maximum, single-spaced (12-point font), and will include an overview of the problem, data, method, and anticipated contribution(s). References are not included in the 5-page limit. We will be evaluating the abstract on fit and potential, not completed analyses. Selected extended abstract submissions will be invited to submit a full paper (see projected timeline and submission type specifics below). We encourage new and interesting work in health analytics and theory.",
        "The objective of this special issue is to showcase how health analytics can be used to enhance theorizing in the field of IS. In addition to its contribution to deep analysis, the power of health analytics research lies in theory development that leverages the unique context of health care. Specifically, the special issue aims to foster research that addresses the question: How can the application and design of analytics methods identify insights from health data and extend IS theory? This special issue places analytics at the forefront of IS research so that health care researchers can make a theoretical contribution to IS research. Through this special issue, we hope to provide an opportunity for emerging and innovative health analytics research to be published that will showcase how new forms and combinations of theoretical reasoning, methods, and data can contribute to theory building.",
        "Our hope is that this special issue will contribute to deeper descriptions, explanations, and predictions of emerging health phenomena relevant to IS scholars as well as demonstrate to clinicians and patients opportunities that will enrich health care management and delivery. We welcome research at the intersection of traditional and emerging approaches, exploratory research, phenomenon-based research, novel methods, and data from any relevant source (with IRB approval, as needed). While we are open to discoveries of all kinds, we expect application of rigorous methods, presentation of persuasive reasoning, and inclusion of strong evidence. Accepted papers will likely contribute in one or more of the following areas, within the context of health analytics: Identification of new patterns or insights that challenge or refine existing assumptions. New (or new to IS) ways of blending the traditional and innovative (e.g.., causal ML). More nuanced understanding of how investments in or use of health analytics can solve societal or organizational resource allocation challenges. Innovative use of disparate data sources, either directly from industry, from publicly available sources, or combinations thereof. We are especially interested in innovative combinations of emerging phenomena, use of AI/ML methods, and insightful data sources. Preference will be given to submissions that showcase emerging and creative approaches to theoretical reasoning, research designs, methods, and/or data. For instance, we are especially interested in application of econometric + machine learning (e.g., EconML) methods to emerging data sources, toward the goal of providing more fine-grained theoretical insights.",
        "Health analytics can be generally described as generating insights from health data through analysis. Significant and impactful work in health analytics is emerging in the IS literature, but there are also significant opportunities to leverage health analytics research to contribute to theorizing in IS. For instance, while interesting findings within IS have been presented in the context of health analytics use in hospitals and clinical diagnostics or care, many health analytics research contexts have yet to be exploited in IS research. The diversity of data and contexts within which to conduct health analytics research is substantial and such diversity is currently underrepresented in IS journals. We propose that health analytics research can advance beyond presentation of context specific models and methods. However, application of these innovative approaches to theory building with health analytics research is at a nascent stage. We see considerable promise in applying such innovative approaches to the enhancement of IS theory, particularly in explaining IS-enabled mechanisms, through research conducted in the health analytics context.",
        "Submissions to this special issue can be: Research Articles (14,000 words or less; see JAIS Instructions for Authors for full requirements), which must include theorizing and an empirical component. Research Briefs (7,000 words or less) which must include an empirical component. The theorizing may be more limited, or more inductive or abductive, if this is a new phenomenon or approach. For this submission type, we suggest being guided by “phenomenon-based theorizing” or a related approach that supports early theory development. Research Perspectives (8,000 words or less), which do not require an empirical component but should “provoke exciting discussion” at the intersection of IS theory and health analytics. Please submit through the JAIS Scholar One submission system and please be sure to state that you are submitting to the “Health Analytics and IS Theorizing Special Issue” in the cover letter. Please also be sure to specify whether you are submitting a Research Article, Research Brief, or a Research Perspective. There is no need to recommend a senior editor or editorial board member, as the guest editors of this special issue will handle all submissions. However, in your cover letter, please do list conflicts of interest with any of the special issue editorial board members."

        "An irony of science is that, despite our devotion to evidence, there is little evidence underpinning many aspects of the journal review process (Linkov et al., 2006; Tennant & Ross-Hellauer 2020). As part of our commitment to continually improving our review processes at MIS Quarterly (MISQ) (Lee, 1999; Saunders, 2005; Straub, 2008; Rai, 2016), this special issue aims to obtain evidence regarding the merits of a recent innovation in the review process—registered reports.",
        "While the registered report model is relatively new, it has been adopted by over 200 journals across the sciences (Chambers, 2019). Business and Information Systems Engineering was the first (and so far, lone) IS journal to adopt this model (Weinhardt et al., 2019). Other early adopters across the business fields include Journal of Accounting Research (JAR), Academy of Management Discoveries, and Leadership Quarterly.",
        "Our goal in this special issue is to learn if the registered report model should be available as an ongoing model for MISQ, as a supplement to our existing options. While we see a lot of promise in the model, we plan to test it first to learn if/how it can best suit our journal.",
        "As Figure 1 shows, the registered report model involves a 2-stage ‘acceptance’ process: a conditional acceptance before data collection, followed by an acceptance if the authors follow the agreed plan.",
        "Compared to a normal review process, there are two main differences:",
        "1. Pre/pilot data may (or may not) have been collected before conditional acceptance, but the main data will not have been collected prior to the conditional acceptance being offered.",
        "2. The paper cannot be rejected due to its results.",
        "Please note that registered reports are not the same as ‘pre-registrations.’ Pre-registrations refer to the activity of registering one’s hypotheses (and other details) prior to testing them. Registered reports go a step further than pre-registrations in that the paper is submitted to the journal before the final data has even been collected.",
        "Early tests of the registered report model across the sciences are yielding positive results (Chambers & Tzavella, 2022; Scheel et al., 2021; Soderberg et al., 2021), especially on the following dimensions: Bias reduction: Registered reports were invented to overcome biases that can occur in review processes when editors/reviewers prefer to see results in a particular direction. For instance, editors/reviewers tend to reject papers with insignificant results, mixed results, or results that run counter to their desires. Registered reports facilitate the publication of such papers. Registered reports can also help reduce biases that affect authors because it frees authors from seeking results they may think they need to obtain to pass the review process. Investment motivation: It often takes substantial time and resources to collect an excellent data set. This can be risky if it may take multiple years to get a paper through the review process, only to get a late-round rejection. On the other hand, if you have received conditional acceptance on your paper before collecting the data, this transfers some of the risk from the authors to the editors. Authors are likely to be much more motivated to undertake the effort/time/cost to get the data if they know that their paper will not get rejected. This should increase our chances of getting higher-investment, higher-impact papers into MISQ.",
        "Submissions to this special issue will be reviewed in a three-step process. Each step will focus on different criteria, which are outlined below: Step 1: Submission Proposals. The senior editors will examine the submission to ensure it matches our criteria for suitability, which are: Does the paper follow a hypothetico-deductive model of science? Does the paper seek to contribute by proposing predictions/hypotheses and testing them against empirical data? Note: Researchers may use the logical of hypothesis testing with many types of data (e.g., qualitative or quantitative, and primary or secondary data). The approach can also be used for many genres of IS research, including behavioral, organizational, design science, and economics. The use of hypothesis-testing also does not necessitate the use of null hypothesis significance testing, e.g., Bayesian methods of analysis can also be used. Is the paper likely to benefit from a registered report model of peer-review compared to a regular peer-review process?",
        "In particular: Bias reduction: Could the research potentially lead to results that contradict expectations and, thereby, trigger biases in a traditional review process (e.g., biases against controversial or null results)? Investment motivation: Could the research involve substantial investments (e.g., time/funds) that a traditional review process may disincentivise? That is, is it reasonable to assume that a research team may put greater effort into a risky empirical project if they have the review team’s support for the paper irrespective of the results? Step 2: Stage 1 Review (prior to final results). Next, the submission will be examined based on criteria for conditional (results-independent) acceptance. Does the paper make hypotheses/predictions that, irrespective of the results, offer the potential for a significant contribution to research and practice? Does the paper propose a research design and analytical approach that, if followed, would allow the purported hypotheses/predictions to be tested with an acceptable degree of rigor? Note: Some pre- or pilot-test results might be included at this stage, to show feasibility of the approach (e.g., for manipulation checks or power calculations), but they are not mandatory. Step 3: Stage 2 Review (paper with results). Lastly, the submission will be examined based on criteria for acceptance, which are: Did the paper implement the accepted research design and analytical approach? Is the paper written to acceptance standards? Additional analyses (optional): While the realization of the results will not affect acceptance, it might result in requests for additional analysis from the editorial/review team to enhance the study’s contribution. Acceptance of the paper does not depend on the pattern of results reported – it only requires the authors to conduct and report the additional analyses."

        "Over the past decades, a vast array of technologies has been introduced in the marketplace to improve the customer experience, leading to stimuli-dense consumption environments (Pantano, Pedeliento, Christodoulides, 2022). Such digital transformation has replaced and supplemented traditional face-to-face consumer interactions with digital-enabled assistants (i.e., apps to automatically locate products in stores, self-serve checkout, or to explore cities without a tourism guide). More recently, as a response to COVID-19, many new technologies were launched to limit consumers’ and service personnel’s exposure to the virus. For instance, in hospitality, new technologies like service robots helped reduce guest interactions with employees and enhance cleanliness (Shin and Kang 2020). Furthermore, the hospitality industry is increasing its use of AI in the form of intelligent voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) to support tourists from hotel room services to travel planning (Loureiro et al., 2021). In retailing, robots and self-service systems have been introduced to points of sale to facilitate contactless or in-home shopping (e.g., new apps to automatically find the products and pay in the store, or new delivery modalities based on drone technology), and AR and VR to improve consumer engagement with products and the shopping experience (Sung et al., 2021). On the one hand, these technologies safeguard consumers’ health and safety (Rahman et al., 2022a). On the other hand, they compensate for the unavailability of human workers, thus providing more automated experiences that could stimulate satiation (Pala et al. 2021). However, incorporating new technologies (e.g., VR, AR, AI) into today’s consumption experiences could have both positive (e.g., escapism, convenience, efficiency) and negative (e.g., binge watching, isolation, frustration, visually induced motion sickness, well-being) impacts on consumers, and broader society (Nanda & Banerjee 2020; Dwivedi et al., 2022).",
        "Past research has largely emphasized the benefits of adopting technologies as decision support aids for consumers (Japutra et al., 2021). However, these technologies also influence human-to-human interactions, which lead companies to change their marketing communication strategies in reaching customers (e.g., shift to digital influencers) (Mishra et al. 2021; Hollebeek et al. 2021; Torres et al. 2019); while dramatically changing the nature of relationship experiences (Pera & Viglia 2016), atmospherics (Roggeveen et al. 2020), and the way consumers process and integrate information between the offline and online environments (Rahman et al., 2022b; Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, Kotler and colleagues (2017) described how new technology might change consumers from being informed to becoming distracted. In this sense, technology in the consumption experience may consume too much of a customer’s attention by requiring them to focus on the system where there are many tasks, complex features, unfamiliar or unresponsive user interfaces. Arguably, customer interaction with technology may potentially reduce individual perception of atmospherics or other environmental stimuli, particularly when these are below the consciousness threshold. Thus, technology might move from being a supporting tool for customer to being a distractive mechanism for inhibiting purchase decision-making.",
        "For instance, in a luxury store setting, technology may distract prospects from opportunities to interact with employees through which they may learn more about the history, heritage, craftmanship and excellent quality of the product. In other cases, technology is a beneficial facilitator that allows deep access to luxury services or products that would not otherwise be attainable (Christodoulides et al. 2021). Similarly, if tourists’ attention is focused on a mobile app showing the best route to reach a certain attraction, s/he might ignore other tourist attractions on their travel journey. This dual nature of technology is unevenly researched in extant literature. Specifically, the distractive and negative effects of technology at the customer interface are still scarcely investigated and understood. This is a pertinent issue given the importance of new technology developments and innovations aligning to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prescribed by the UN, including responsible consumption and production in society (Dwivedi et al., 2022). Therefore, this Special Issue will address the interplay between a customer’s experience with technology and its associated distracting mechanisms, as triggered by their interaction with technology in varied consumption contexts. Conceptual, methodological, qualitative, or quantitative contributions that offer insight in this area are equally welcome by the Guest Editors. The Special Issue would accept papers focusing on topics including, but not limited to, the following:"

        "The availability of and access to big data has changed, as digital transformation initiatives are increasingly maturing globally, assisted by the growth of computational capabilities. Whilst data availability and access used to be a major challenge for information systems (IS) research, the current abundance of big data has now resolved this considerably. The theoretical building blocks of IS research come mainly from management theory, organization theory, behavioural theory, computer science theories, and systems theory. Apart from the core computer science theories, the other related theories enable IS researchers to explain how users interact with technology artefacts within individual, organizational, social, and political contexts and the impact of such interaction. Theory building, however, seems to have been disrupted by the current trends in big data-driven research, whereby the essence of contributing to theory is increasingly seen to be lacking at all levels of analysis. Concurrently, big data-driven research may inspire contributions towards design science and action research, whereby innovative solutions may also be created which help to define ideas, capabilities, practices, and innovative products or services through big data analysis.",
        "While big data-driven studies are increasingly gaining popularity within IS research, they rarely introspect why a phenomenon is better explained by a theory and limit the analysis to what is happening by merely mining relevant data. Many such studies try to collect data and showcase applications of data science and visualization of unstructured, large volumes of data by demonstrating sentiment analysis, text mining, networks, and communities, without significant contribution to the theoretical context within which the problem is situated. Such studies do not attempt to explain why a particular phenomenon is witnessed and the data descriptions rarely contribute towards theory building. Thus, such studies have a weak connection with the relevant theories and IT artefacts, paying greater attention to data collection and analysis. Furthermore, since the data collection is often dated, such studies lose timeliness and do not attempt to explain causality.",
        "This special issue intends to facilitate theory-focused research, based on the analysis of big data as outlined in the directions provided in a recent opinion paper published in the journal. We specifically seek for theory building attempts in addressing grand individual, organizational, social or political problems. In particular, studies should demonstrate ample representative elements of big data such as high volume, velocity, variety, variability, veracity, visualization, and leading to value in understanding the phenomenon under examination. Authors need to explain why a phenomenon is happening rather that what is happening. The connection with IT artefacts must be significantly strong, while studies on emerging technologies are also of interest. Units of analysis could be individuals, groups or organizations. Of particular interest are theories explaining the nature of interaction among entities from more than a single unit type. Further, studies which mine more than a single type of unstructured data, and multi-methodology studies are also of interest, provided they contribute to theory building. Data could potentially be extracted from platforms like social media, communication networks, text-based data, images, multi-media, online communities, application-based data, sensor-based data, location-based data, data from smart-phones, smart devices and wearables. Other sources would also be welcome as long as the studies contribute theoretically. For submissions to this special issue, prospective authors are encouraged to revisit recent examples of such endeavours in the IS literature."

        "Blockchain technology has received enormous attention since Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and has become the frontier of technology advancements and application innovations in recent years. In particular, blockchain is now recognized as a critical part of the new ABCD of modern technology, that is, Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, and big Data. However, many research challenges and opportunities remain to be tackled and surmounted in areas such as blockchain infrastructure decentralization, blockchain network governance, blockchain security and privacy, and the nature of machine trust in blockchain-based systems. Because blockchain is an integral part of automated business processes, the implementation of this technology can vary greatly between organizations across different industries.",
        "The aim of this special issue is to highlight novel and high-quality research in blockchain technology and applications, and to examine the current and future impact of blockchain systems, and related technologies including data verification before block confirmation, authentication of data ownership, and dataflow across blockchain systems. Considering the decision-making focus of DSS publications that bridge the gap between managerial and technical perspectives, this special issue is open to all manuscripts that make a significant research contribution to blockchain systems and applications in business sectors such as finance, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, supply chain, education, and government.",
        "In terms of research paradigm, we invite manuscripts with system-based implications that draw on various analytical, empirical, and technical methodologies including, but not limited to, system development, econometrics, decision theory, operations management, experimentation, and engineering. We strongly encourage submissions that follow a design science research perspective, which aims to develop cutting-edge IT artifacts. That is, all technical and quantitative research methods that are helpful in tackling real-world challenges confronted by managers, engineers, and researchers via blockchain technology are welcome."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Pervasive digitalization has influenced practically all aspects of the human experience and our institutions in business, society, and government. Diverse areas such as organizational management and strategy, urban affairs and city planning, healthcare, entertainment, safety, politics, and transportation have all been inexorably shaped by digital technologies. Such technologies have created non-trivial and non-reversible changes to our individual and collective behaviors, our institutions and organizations, as well as to human society and our planet at large.",
        "But with great power also comes great responsibility. The transformational changes from digitalization are neither unequivocally positive nor negative; more often than not, they are laden with ethical tensions between the contrasting outcomes they engender. For example, personal data digitalization can help individuals live longer and heal their lives, but it also challenges individual rights, obligations, and our sense of dignity. Social media allows us greater connectivity and access, upholding the democratic principle of collective voice, but also becomes a vehicle for manipulating public opinion and spreading fake news and falsehood. Emerging technologies such as shared electric vehicles are coining a revolution in the mobility and energy sector, but also increase fears of labor substitution. The datafication of everyday behaviors has led to new healthcare opportunities but also increased surveillance. The wide embracement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) propels new opportunities for automation and decision-making, but also raises thorny ethical issues in terms of accountability, privacy, fairness, discrimination, and further biases.",
        "These observations surface the fact that digital technologies invoke competing narratives: the transformational and innovative powers of digital technologies often contrast dysfunctional outcomes of digitalization, such as social endangerment or loss of human voice and autonomy. While digital technologies promise an exciting future, we have been cautioned that 'the journey to the fully pervasive digitized world is also likely to be perilous' and 'as much as the potential benefits of digital technology are real, so too are the risks and complexity that ride with them.' Therefore, the key question that we must ask is: how can we positively leverage the transformational powers of digital technologies without falling prey to their possible dysfunctional outcomes? We believe that the answer to this complex question partly lies in the consideration of an important construct: responsibility.",
        "Responsibility allows us to evaluate transformational digital technologies in a balanced manner, by factoring in both harmful and positive outcomes from the engagement with such artifacts. Responsibility has become a salient term in this digital age, inspiring new streams of research such as corporate digital responsibility and responsible innovation. Forcing us to engage in meta-ethical reflection, responsibility is crucial to addressing some of the dysfunctional outcomes associated with the rapid proliferation of digital technologies – thus allowing for normative action consistent with human values and ethical defensibility. As information systems researchers, it must be on us to better understand the concept of responsibility as it pertains to the enablement of positive outcomes of ongoing digitalization of our everyday lives while safeguarding the human experience against possible negative consequences of the same. We term this concept 'digital responsibility', which we believe can serve as an organizing construct of research that aims to inform the balancing of ethical and humanistic tensions pertaining to the rapid proliferation of digital technologies.",
        "Notably, focusing on digital responsibility allows us to challenge the often-embraced utopic narrative of digitalization – thus problematizing our vision for this special issue. Digital responsibility is antithetical to 'mindlessness' in designing and implementing digital technologies, which is often associated with the inability 'to cope gracefully with changing, complex situations characteristic of high-risk domains.' The lens of digital responsibility necessitates that we embark upon rigorously analyzing, explaining, predicting, as well as influencing, the potential costs, duties, and obligations of decisions that relate to the development, implementation, and use of digital information and communication technologies. Following such observations, unpacking the phenomenon of 'digital responsibility' should be of utmost concern to IS researchers – and this is the central theme of this special issue.",
        "We are interested in novel, exciting, and thought-provoking contributions that build cumulative knowledge about 'digital responsibility' across all levels (personal, corporate, institutional, and societal) and domains of responsibility (individual, social, ethical, and ecological)."
