      "Changing meanings/definitions of creativity: Creativity is frequently seen as a human accomplishment in light of artificial intelligence (AI) and the shifting boundaries between the tasks typically requiring human vs machine capabilities. How has the meaning and definition of creativity evolved over time? What historical inflection points are there that resemble the one we are faced with today? What might we learn from the history of creativity?",
      "Accountability of computer creativity: When a product/service is designed by an algorithm (e.g., Dreamcatcher designing a chair), where does accountability for failure lie? What are the legal and ethical implications of analytical/computational creativity?",
      "Creativity as an (efficient) search problem: What algorithms are the most effective when a creative task is approached as a search problem? Under what conditions (e.g., decision parameters/constraints; process cost criteria) is one search algorithm better than its closest rivals?",
      "Approaches to analytical creativity: How should a designer select among the different approaches to/tools for analytical creativity? How do the outcomes differ? Under what conditions is one approach superior to others?",
      "Human-Algorithm collaboration in creative tasks: Under what conditions is human-algorithm cooperation in creativity superior (e.g., in terms of innovation/output, tangible and intangible process costs) to algorithmic-only or human-only creativity? What are the critical success factors of human-algorithm creative tasks?",
      "Human replicable artificial creative intelligence: Innovation methods that do not rely on innate ability and can lead to replicable innovation results when used by different innovators. Can methods that are generalizable and applicable to many domains (such as TRIZ, Logical Creativity Theory) be developed?",
      "Role of neuroscience in creativity research: The IS field has explored neuroscientific techniques in the last decade (e.g., Dimoka, Pavlou, and Davis 201; Riedl et al. 2020). Can a neuroscientific approach lead to a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanism of creativity (of a specific task), via experimental and/or computational research (Abraham 2018)? Can it generate artificial analytical creative models that can achieve human empathy (for example, via perception of trustworthiness based on visual and audio signals)?",
      "Levels of analysis: Are creative tasks decomposable into self-contained units, each of which can be solved by a logical process?",
      "Institutional level creativity: Can we develop processes that organizations can use to ensure creativity that is not dependent on any specific individual?",
      "Application of creativity: What are important and critical problems that need creative solutions? What value is attributed to creativity in different application domains, e.g., entertainment vs. education vs. NGOs focused on major social issues including poverty reduction, food security and clean energy."

        "Creativity is typically defined as the capacity to produce something – either abstract or physical -- that is (1) new; and (2) valuable. Recent rapid advances in generative models such as GPT-4 by OpenAI, which is capable of generating unlimited new output (e.g., writing, image) that are arguably indistinguishable from human creative output, have surprised many. This new class of technology is also energizing the scholarly interest in creativity.",
        "Kaufman and Beghetto (2009) proposed a Four C model for creativity, mini-c (transformative learning), little-c (everyday creativity), Pro-c (professional expertise), and Big-C (eminent creative contributions). While human creativity has led to tremendous progress in science, technology, and society, the performance of creativity is nevertheless treated as a black box by both academics and practitioners. We know about environments and activities that are conducive to creative tasks – ranging from brainstorming to going for a run -- but we do not know precisely how human creativity works. This makes it challenging to enact it reliably and at scale.",
        "But algorithmic creativity performed by generative large language models such as Chat GPT and other AI applications is just as impenetrable. While these algorithms can produce exceptional new ideas and outputs (e.g., the Dreamcatcher chair), their designers (e.g., OpenAI) do not fully understand how these models work.",
        "Nevertheless, recent advances in neuroscience and computer science point to a form of creativity – namely analytical creativity – that can potentially yield creative outcomes in a replicable manner. Analytical creativity conceptualizes the creative task as a search problem whose purpose is to find the most desirable outcome, which is defined in terms of newness/originality and value, within a vast theoretical space, and to do so optimally (low search cost). Its goal is to uncover the process behind human or machine creativity. Using an analogy: the traditional conception of creativity is similar to a magician’s performance as viewed from the audience’s perspective. To the average viewer, the acts are beyond explanation and thus magical. But in reality, every magician’s performance is achieved by following a carefully designed recipe of action, which include slights of hand that capitalize on human’s perceptual weaknesses.",
        "What if creativity is not so much a stroke of genius or ‘divine inspiration,’ but a rather mundane process that, once understood, can be automated? Evidence is mounting that this might indeed be the case. Using brain image and computational models, neuroscience provides a more structured understanding of how our brains process a creative task in a systematic way. Recent developments in deep learning research have led to interpretable models that can identify new game-playing strategies, generate visual art, and compose songs (e.g., large language models).",
        "Such deep learning models are beginning to unmask the complex steps involved in human creativity. For example, the process of how protein folds, which is a significant component of how the creative process is performed by the brain, has been broken down into 3D structures (Eisenstein 2021). Together with the research on neuroscience, this evidence has coalesced into a stream of creativity research that posits that the creative process shares commonality across domains, and that it can be learned, practiced, and performed with consistent results. Examples of this stream of research on analytical creativity include Altshuller’s (1984) theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) and Ding’s (2020) logical creativity theory.",
        "Analytical creativity is a more general concept than computational creativity, an emerging multidisciplinary domain that seeks to “model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends: construct a program or computer capable of human-level creativity to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans; to design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves."

        "The 21st Century has been termed “the century of disasters” (Achenbach 2011). These include natural and human-caused disasters. The former encompass geophysical (e.g., earthquakes), hydrological (e.g., floods), climatological (e.g., wildfires), meteorological (e.g., cyclones), or biological (e.g., disease epidemics such as COVID-19) disasters. The latter are caused by human-led events, such as conflicts, famine, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity incidents, and industrial accidents (IFRC 2010). A myriad of factors has contributed to a surge in disasters: technological innovation, population growth, climate change, demographic changes, and evolving social dynamics. When they happen, such disasters exact a devastating toll on civil and technical infrastructure and society as a whole (e.g., loss of human life, social and economic disturbances, and environmental damage).",
        "In extreme cases where natural and human-caused disasters join forces, the suffering of victims often increases exponentially. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 has added a new threat to refugees and humanitarian resettlement programs (CDC 2020). The International Rescue Committee (2020) commented that “People in refugee camps in Syria, Greece and Bangladesh face a heightened risk of COVID-19 due to more densely populated conditions than even the Diamond Princess—the cruise ship where transmission of the virus was four times faster than in Wuhan.”",
        "Worldwide, government agencies, private sectors, and the public are in desperate search for new tools, practices, and strategies to safeguard society against the threat of disasters (Chen et al. 2013; Park et al. 2015). For policy makers, Information technology (IT) has been considered important in enabling and supporting efficient and effective disaster management. In recognition of the potential role of IT, as early as 2007, the United States Congress followed the E-government Act of 2002 to direct the National Research Council to study the application of IT to disaster management. Over the past decade, the world has seen an increasing level of IT use in modern disaster management (Beydoun et al. 2018). Examples include blockchain for disaster logistics, wearable technologies for rescue teams and victims, remote monitoring sensors for intelligence gathering, virtual reality for response preparedness and training, GIS for crisis mapping, social media for disaster information dissemination and extraction of real-time intelligence, and big data for impact assessment and forecasting. Such IT uses have been found across the globe.",
        "Management of disasters is challenging for its multi-phase, multi-hazard, multi-stakeholder, multi-task, multi-objective nature. First, disaster management follows multiple phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In the example of the preparedness phase, efforts are taken to develop a single- or all-hazard disaster plan, evaluate and modify the plan, exercise the plan (e.g., table-top exercises or drills), and stock inventory (e.g., water and food). These phases are interconnected as the performance of one response phase affects that of the next phase. Second, disaster management calls for different specialties and strategies in response to various disaster types, such as pandemics, terrorist attacks, mass shootings, earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, hurricanes, and train derailments. For example, management of pandemic and terrorist attacks focus on responding to and containing a disaster after its appearance (i.e., reactionary), whereas floods and hurricanes necessitate proactive mitigation strategies in anticipation of the disaster. Third, disaster management involves a broad stakeholder approach, potentially encompassing international coalitions (e.g., the U.N.), local government, public safety and security (e.g., Fire, Police, and Hazmat), logistics providers, public health and medical services, humanitarian / social society organizations, military, transportation, utility and public works, donors, media, and business/civilian victims. While these stakeholders might agree on the general principle of social good, their exact goals and objectives might vary (Abbasi et al. 2019). Fourth, disaster management handles a wide range of operations, such as unified command, situational assessment, coordinated operations, risk assessment (Tinsley et al. 2011; Dillion and Tinsley 2008), impact analysis, resource allocation, victim assistance, supply chain and logistics, and financing. Fifth, disaster management works to achieve objectives such as preserving lives and properties, containing the impact, protecting the health and safety of response personnel, safeguarding the natural environment, sustaining business and civilian activities, protecting critical infrastructures, informing the public, and restoring and rebuilding affected communities. Finally, disaster management consists of mitigation of harm in the disaster context, which may include examination of harms and harm quantification, tracing the impact of harm and identifying susceptible population, and dissemination of harm.",
        "To help policy makers, IT can provide strategic support that addresses each aspect of disaster management. In the example of multi-stakeholder support, IT can be used to interconnect stakeholders for building response partnerships. In doing so, it is also important to avoid IT misuse which may create digital chaos and impede first responders and other offline disaster management activities; for instance, human- or bot-led propagation of false information on social media. The security and privacy issues of IT use surrounding disaster management is also an important consideration. Compared with other disciplines (e.g., Management Science), scholars in IS have been relatively silent about disaster management – new findings on the proper design, use, and management of IT can undoubtedly have a huge real-world impact. IS research in disaster management may be performed at multiple levels: individual, organizational, and social. Different methods, such as qualitative, quantitative, data science, and design science can all contribute to building a stronger body of knowledge."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Sustainability is a moral and existential imperative of our time. As Information Systems (IS) scholars, we are aware of the immense impact of digital technologies on efforts and initiatives towards sustainable practice happening locally and globally. Furthermore, because digital phenomena lie at the heart of our discipline, IS researchers are well positioned to join these efforts. This Special Issue aims to champion new digital sustainability research programs targeting the planet’s most pressing sustainability challenges from the past decade.",
        "We hope it will contribute towards building novel collective knowledge and help shape digital sustainability research in IS. Human society is approaching the edge of a dangerous precipice. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report unequivocally confirms that human activities have caused global warming, predicting that even with current commitments and mitigation efforts, it will be difficult to limit warming below the critical threshold of 2oC (IPCC, 2023). The planet’s air, land, and water continue to be threatened on several fronts, with research suggesting that the safe operating zone for six of the nine planetary boundaries has already been breached (Stockholm Resilience Centre, n.d.).",
        "Over the past decade, extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, fires and heatwaves have not only increased in frequency but also in magnitude. In addition to causing environmental impacts, these events have a significant impact on society, further complicating the pursuit of social and economic sustainability. In 2020, about 724 million people were living in conditions of extreme poverty, with almost 30% of the world’s population suffering from some level of food insecurity (United Nations, 2023). Equality for women and other marginalized groups continues to lag. The World Bank (2022) reports that 2.4 billion women globally do not have the same economic rights as men, and despite the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 (United Nations, 2007), Indigenous Peoples around the world continue to suffer the intergenerational trauma of colonization.",
        "The trend towards urbanization endures, with cities struggling to ensure inclusive, resilient, and sustainable living environments for all residents (United Nations 2023). On top of all these challenges, violent conflicts have led to the forced migration of millions of people and the deaths of thousands of civilians (United Nations 2023). These alarming circumstances highlight the lack of progress towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. As stated in the 2023 Progress Report, the promise of leaving no one behind is in peril: of 140 measured targets, only 12% are on track for 2030, and about half are moderately or severely off track.",
        "In response to the urgent need to address sustainability challenges, organizations, governments and industries worldwide have started to make efforts in recent years to harness the potential of digital technologies. Examples of such efforts range from specific solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors widely used by many organizations to pursue sustainability objectives, to the birth of new data-driven companies that are applying advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to offer sustainability-related data services. This harnessing of digital technologies to address sustainability challenges has impacted the way practitioners view this emerging trend, which they increasingly refer to as digital sustainability.",
        "For example, Gartner describes digital sustainability as harnessing the tools of digital transformation, such as enhanced connectivity and the Internet of Things (IoT), to improve the environment and support sustainable business operations. On a global scale, the United Nations has initiated conversations on the relationship between digital sustainability and environmental concerns. For example, the focus of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is ‘accelerating and scaling environmental sustainability by applying data, digital technologies, and solutions to UNEP’s key activities, products, and services and ultimately delivers on its key action areas— climate, nature, and pollution.' In the domain of social sustainability, the United Nations chosen theme of ‘DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality’ for International Women’s Day 2023 emphasizes the potential of digital technologies for empowering women and girls.",
        "However, IS research has been lagging behind the digital sustainability discourse happening in practice. As argued in a recent JAIS editorial on digital sustainability (Kotlarsky et al., 2023), the IS research community has a strong foundation to draw upon, ranging from research into Green IS to studies addressing significant societal challenges. As Urquhart and her colleagues (2008) note, the poor cannot eat technology, but the mindful design and use of technology can contribute to innovative solutions and positive impacts.",
        "In particular, we consider that the recent shift in the way IS research approaches digital phenomena offers new perspectives on the relationship between digital technologies and sustainability. Building on Baskerville et al.’s (2020) contention that the classical view of an information system as representing and reflecting physical reality has become obsolete, we agree that an ontological reversal has taken place at the junction between technology and sustainability whereby the digital version of business solutions is created first and the physical version second. As a result, the assumption that IS only represents the physical assets within sustainability phenomena is being challenged. This provides an opportunity for the IS community to drive a more inclusive agenda on digital sustainability, one that encompasses phenomena in which the impact of digital technologies and macro-level environmental, social, and economic objectives converge.",
        "Accordingly, this Special Issue seeks contributions that delve into digital sustainability and encompass the development, deployment, and utilization of digital resources and artifacts toward improving the environment, society, and economic welfare. We invite original and thought-provoking studies that advance and shape our understanding of digital sustainability as an emerging research area.",
        "We are interested in studies that contribute to our understanding of environmental and/or social sustainability, and studies that elucidate new forms of digital sustainability. We therefore welcome studies that engage with digital sustainability by building on theoretical foundations from the extant IS literature, as well as studies that bring insights from other disciplines into the IS research domain. Furthermore, we seek studies that consider digital sustainability at all levels and perspectives, in the context of developing and developed nations. We specifically welcome submissions that integrate more than one dimension of digital sustainability—the environment, society, and/or economic welfare. Overall, we aim to present a collection of papers that provides a balanced, integrated, and cumulative perspective on digital sustainability."

      "paragraphs": [
        "The origins of generative AI (GAI) can be traced back to the 1950s, when Alan Turing proposed a test to determine whether a machine could be perceived as intelligent enough to generate responses to questions in a way indistinguishable from a human. Later, in the 1970s, researchers developed more advanced models capable of producing more realistic and coherent outcomes. Contemporary GAI models are based on state-of-the-art neural network architectures. They combine such architectures to develop large models that outperform existing benchmarked ones. Contemporary GAI solutions can therefore produce large amounts of contextual outputs on any specific topic. They are highly trained and sophisticated, enabling users to produce various types of AI-generated content. Although GAI has been around for a while, recent developments have brought the potential of such solutions to the forefront. In particular, LLMs have the potential to transform the way we develop textual content and communicate with one another. The latest developments in GAI have increased its potential for use in a wide range of industries like healthcare, customer service, media, marketing, finance, biopharma among others. The ongoing discourse on GAI seems to extol the promises of AI and the dangers. Such discourse is well chronicled for many technologies in the Gartner hype cycle. New technologies spawn overenthusiasm, followed by disillusionment and eventually enlightenment, as we learn how to use them. In every case, the technology is heralded as incredible, and predictions, both constructive and destructive, run rampant. Our goal for this Special Issue is to offer a careful examination of the challenges faced in managing this powerful set of technologies for individuals, organizations, and society.",
        "Many, but not all, of the challenges around GAI concern data. Over 90% of internet data will be produced by GAI models, triggering serious concerns about harmful and abusive content generation. Most current GAI-triggered use involves chat-based digital assistants. While the outcome of GAI in these digital assistant-based applications is indeed remarkable, their effectiveness depends on the level of task specificity and the need for information synthesis. Organizations and governments face challenges associated with policies of data protection and content moderation. For example, the Italian government has temporarily limited the processing of personal data by OpenAI, thereby forcing OpenAI to block ChatGPT in that region. OpenAI itself anticipated the potential applications by fraudsters and released a feature that allows the users to apply a content filtering flag to potentially problematic content. Organizations might have other challenges regarding data protection. For example, a computer manufacturer decided to adopt GAI and then transfer its knowledge base to GAI platforms, but these internal information assets of the firm became available in the data repository of the LLMs."

        "The objective of this special issue is to showcase how health analytics can be used to enhance theorizing in the field of IS. In addition to its contribution to deep analysis, the power of health analytics research lies in theory development that leverages the unique context of health care. Specifically, the special issue aims to foster research that addresses the question: How can the application and design of analytics methods identify insights from health data and extend IS theory? This special issue places analytics at the forefront of IS research so that health care researchers can make a theoretical contribution to IS research. Through this special issue, we hope to provide an opportunity for emerging and innovative health analytics research to be published that will showcase how new forms and combinations of theoretical reasoning, methods, and data can contribute to theory building.",
        "Our hope is that this special issue will contribute to deeper descriptions, explanations, and predictions of emerging health phenomena relevant to IS scholars as well as demonstrate to clinicians and patients opportunities that will enrich health care management and delivery. We welcome research at the intersection of traditional and emerging approaches, exploratory research, phenomenon-based research, novel methods, and data from any relevant source (with IRB approval, as needed). While we are open to discoveries of all kinds, we expect application of rigorous methods, presentation of persuasive reasoning, and inclusion of strong evidence. Accepted papers will likely contribute in one or more of the following areas, within the context of health analytics: Identification of new patterns or insights that challenge or refine existing assumptions, new (or new to IS) ways of blending the traditional and innovative (e.g., causal ML), more nuanced understanding of how investments in or use of health analytics can solve societal or organizational resource allocation challenges, and innovative use of disparate data sources, either directly from industry, from publicly available sources, or combinations thereof. We are especially interested in innovative combinations of emerging phenomena, use of AI/ML methods, and insightful data sources. Preference will be given to submissions that showcase emerging and creative approaches to theoretical reasoning, research designs, methods, and/or data. For instance, we are especially interested in application of econometric + machine learning (e.g., EconML) methods to emerging data sources, toward the goal of providing more fine-grained theoretical insights.",
        "Health analytics can be generally described as generating insights from health data through analysis. Significant and impactful work in health analytics is emerging in the IS literature (e.g., Bardhan et al., 2015; Bygstad et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2021; Kankanhalli et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Son et al., 2020), but there are also significant opportunities to leverage health analytics research to contribute to theorizing in IS. For instance, while interesting findings within IS have been presented in the context of health analytics use in hospitals (Bardhan et al., 2015; Bygstad et al., 2020) and clinical diagnostics or care (Fang et al., 2021; Son et al., 2020), many health analytics research contexts have yet to be exploited in IS research. In medical, health informatics, and data science literatures, the consideration of health analytics has been much more diverse. Studies have been conducted, for example, on how to apply ML toward a deeper understanding of substance abuse treatment disparities (Nasir et al., 2021), identifying latent topics associated with COVID-19 vaccine discussions on Twitter (Lyu et al., 2021), making connections between research disciplines during viral outbreaks (Powers-Fletcher et al., 2021), and optimal use of visualizations to reduce cognitive load and increase efficacy of health analytics output use by clinicians (Caban & Gotz, 2015). The diversity of data and contexts within which to conduct health analytics research is substantial and such diversity is currently underrepresented in IS journals. We propose that health analytics research can advance beyond presentation of context specific models and methods. For instance, we now know a lot more about how to effectively manage AI resources (Berente et al., 2021), how chronic disease information can be leveraged to improve outcomes (Bardhan et al., 2020), and how machine learning (Leavitt et al., 2021; Padmanabhan et al., 2022; Tremblay et al., 2021) and computational approaches (Berente et al., 2019; Miranda et al., 2022; Shrestha et al., 2021) can be leveraged for theory building. However, application of these innovative approaches to theory building with health analytics research is at a nascent stage. We see considerable promise in applying such innovative approaches to the enhancement of IS theory, particularly in explaining IS-enabled mechanisms, through research conducted in the health analytics context.",
        "Submissions to this special issue can be: Research Articles (14,000 words or less; see JAIS Instructions for Authors for full requirements), which must include theorizing and an empirical component; Research Briefs (7,000 words or less) which must include an empirical component. The theorizing may be more limited, or more inductive or abductive, if this is a new phenomenon or approach; Research Perspectives (8,000 words or less), which do not require an empirical component but should “provoke exciting discussion” at the intersection of IS theory and health analytics. For this submission type, please focus on an interesting area of debate or tension. We encourage perspectives such as: free market vs. drug pricing controls, data privacy vs. public good, mandatory vs. voluntary use of predictive (or prescriptive) models in areas such as clinical decision making, risk adjustment, utility vs. cost functions applied to patient behavior nudges, standard vs. heterogenous treatment effects, inferential vs. ML approaches. Please submit through the JAIS Scholar One submission system and please be sure to state that you are submitting to the “Health Analytics and IS Theorizing Special Issue” in the cover letter. Please also be sure to specify whether you are submitting a Research Article, Research Brief, or a Research Perspective. There is no need to recommend a senior editor or editorial board member, as the guest editors of this special issue will handle all submissions. However, in your cover letter, please do list conflicts of interest with any of the special issue editorial board members."

        "Pervasive digitalization has influenced practically all aspects of the human experience and our institutions in business, society, and government. Diverse areas such as organizational management and strategy, urban affairs and city planning, healthcare, entertainment, safety, politics, and transportation have all been inexorably shaped by digital technologies. Such technologies have created non-trivial and nonreversible changes to our individual and collective behaviors, our institutions and organizations, as well as to human society and our planet at large.",
        "But with great power also comes great responsibility. The transformational changes from digitalization are neither unequivocally positive nor negative; more often than not, they are laden with ethical tensions between the contrasting outcomes they engender. For example, personal data digitalization can help individuals live longer and healthier lives, but it also challenges individual rights, obligations, and our sense of dignity. Social media allows us greater connectivity and access, upholding the democratic principle of collective voice, but also becomes a vehicle for manipulating public opinion and spreading fake news and falsehood. Emerging technologies such as shared electric vehicles are coining a revolution in the mobility and energy sector, but also increase fears of labor substitution. The datafication of everyday behaviors has led to new healthcare opportunities but also increased surveillance. The wide embracement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) propels new opportunities for automation and decision-making, but also raises thorny ethical issues in terms of accountability, privacy, fairness, discrimination, and further biases. These observations surface the fact that digital technologies invoke competing narratives: the transformational and innovative powers of digital technologies often contrast dysfunctional outcomes of digitalization, such as social endangerment or loss of human voice and autonomy.",
        "While digital technologies promise an exciting future, we have been cautioned that the journey to the fully pervasive digitized world is also likely to be perilous and as much as the potential benefits of digital technology are real, so too are the risks and complexity that ride with them. Therefore, the key question that we must ask is: how can we positively leverage the transformational powers of digital technologies without falling prey to their possible dysfunctional outcomes? We believe that the answer to this complex question partly lies in the consideration of an important construct: responsibility. Responsibility allows us to evaluate transformational digital technologies in a balanced manner, by factoring in both harmful and positive outcomes from the engagement with such artifacts. Responsibility has become a salient term in this digital age, inspiring new streams of research such as corporate digital responsibility and responsible innovation. Forcing us to engage in meta-ethical reflection, responsibility is crucial to addressing some of the dysfunctional outcomes associated with the rapid proliferation of digital technologies – thus allowing for normative action consistent with human values and ethical defensibility. As information systems researchers, it must be on us to better understand the concept of responsibility as it pertains to the enablement of positive outcomes of ongoing digitalization of our everyday lives while safeguarding the human experience against possible negative consequences of the same. We term this concept “digital responsibility”, which we believe can serve as an organizing construct of research that aims to inform the balancing of ethical and humanistic tensions pertaining to the rapid proliferation of digital technologies. Notably, focusing on digital responsibility allows us to challenge the often-embraced utopic narrative of digitalization – thus problematizing our vision for this special issue.",
        "Digital responsibility is antithetical to “mindlessness” in designing and implementing digital technologies, which is often associated with the inability to cope gracefully with changing, complex situations characteristic of high-risk domains. The lens of digital responsibility necessitates that we embark upon rigorously analyzing, explaining, predicting, as well as influencing, the potential costs, duties, and obligations of decisions that relate to the development, implementation, and use of digital information and communication technologies. Following such observations, unpacking the phenomenon of “digital responsibility” should be of utmost concern to IS researchers – and this is the central theme of this special issue. We are interested in novel, exciting, and thought-provoking contributions that build cumulative knowledge about “digital responsibility” across all levels (personal, corporate, institutional, and societal) and domains of responsibility (individual, social, ethical, and ecological). So as not to constrain the range of contributions, we suggest understanding digital responsibility broadly as any accountabilities, liabilities, responsibilities, obligations, and duties that relate to the design, development, implementation, use and impact of digital technologies. We deliberately do not limit the call to a specific domain, theoretical lens, or research approach. We are looking for contributions that contain a substantive IS perspective but may also feature interdisciplinary approaches (both theoretical and methodological). We also impose no constraints in terms of theory, method, paradigm, or context. We do not want labels and scripts associated with traditional IS paradigms, such as behavioral, design, economic, or organizational research, to constrain how this important and complex phenomenon is investigated. We welcome the entire spectrum of information systems research and invite innovative, rigorous, relevant, and exciting research on digital responsibility. We welcome empirical, design, as well as conceptual work, and we also welcome carefully crafted commentaries, research perspectives, or opinions. However, in every submission, the chosen research topic should be contemporary and relevant, speaking to current grand challenges of our time. We are not interested in papers that advance methodological contributions even if they might have relevance to the study of digital responsibility. We also do not seek papers that advance our understanding of how to build theory about digital responsibility. Likewise, we are not interested in papers whose contributions about digital responsibility build on data that were not originally collected for that purpose. Finally, contributions in which digital responsibility is merely a by-product of some other contribution, however valuable, are also not what we are after."

        "Life transitions forms a rich area of scholarship for Information Science research. The last five years have seen a steady growth in the publication of empirical studies related to transition, including PhD work and longitudinal studies, in a variety of areas including health, social, academic and employment contexts. At the same time, emerging conceptual work has also started to re-examine transition through a historical lens, including how change and adjustment has been treated in historical Information Science scholarship. This adds significant scope for complex conceptual work. The breadth of interest further means that transition has the potential to unify various related fields of study, including information behaviour, practice, and literacy research as well as various disciplinary fields. This Special Issue will provide a platform for the exploration of life transitions from an information behaviour, information practice, or information literacy perspective. The aim is to develop the emerging conceptualisation of what transition means in these fields of study through examining different theoretical models, methodological approaches, and empirical findings. This Special Issue will act as focal point for growing theoretical and empirical interest in the relationship between life transitions and information.",
        "Transitions are a natural state in everyday life. In a broader sense, individuals could be said to be in a constant state of transition, or 'transitioning' with every passage in life. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, transition is defined both as a noun and adverb, it is both: 'A passing or passage from one condition, action, or (rarely) place, to another; 'change' and, 'To make or undergo a transition (from one state, system, etc. to or into another); to change over or switch.' From a research perspective, transition is a complex topic that has been variously conceptualised and defined. Transitions can be personal (changes due to changes in life cycle), situational (changes in circumstances in personal or professional life), or environmental (changes in the organisational environment impacting individuals) (Schumacher & Meleis, 1994). These emphases mean that transition has been most comprehensively explored to date within the field of Education and Nursing. Conceptual work in these areas has focused on the process through which people in transition move beyond a disrupted reality to construct a new reality. Information has been found to be a strong trigger in the transition process. Transitions fracture the individual’s information landscapes and require them to learn new 'ways of knowing' (Lloyd, 2017), a process that often requires both seeking and avoiding information as a coping mechanism to reduce uncertainty (Savolainen, 2017). This notion of a 'gappy' reality (Dervin, 1999, p. 370) resonates with sense-making’s premise of discontinuity (Dervin, 2003) as a fundamental aspect of reality that mandates humans to 'take steps to construct sense in constantly changing life situations.' (Savolainen, 1993, p. 16).",
        "Although transitions are permeated with information practices of many kinds, information behaviour / practices/ literacy research has engaged only peripherally with ideas of transition and the concept remains underexplored (e.g. Bronstein, 2018; Karim, Widén & Heinström, 2019; Hertzum & Hyldegård, 2019; Hicks, 2019; Huttunen & Kortalainen, 2021; Lloyd, 2017; McKenzie, 2001; Ruthven, 2021; Willson, 2019). Consequently, the aim of this special issue is to extend these initial explorations of transition through an information lens. We invite empirical, conceptual or methodological submissions for this special issue that address one or more of these questions."

        "General web search engines are an essential part of today's information infrastructure. They have made it possible to find almost anything on the Internet by typing a few keywords into an empty search box. In fact, search engines have become so integrated into devices and practices that you can get an answer before you even knew how to phrase the question. Search engines shape our lives and at the same time shape the society and culture we live in. We use them at work, in school, in research, in planning our vacations, in finding products, and in politics – just to name a few important areas.",
        "The search engine market is dominated by a few companies that have divided the market into regions: Baidu in China, Yandex in Russia and Google in much of the Western world. More competition between search engines is often called for, but is very difficult to achieve. On the other side, we find the content providers doing everything they can by employing various types of search engine optimization (SEO) to achieve the highest rank in the search engine results page when people search for information. In information science, search engines have been studied mainly in the subfield of information retrieval and information behaviour. The study of search engines has thus been a core task of information science since the discipline's beginnings in the 1960s and even before (Saracevic, 2009).",
        "With concepts such as relevance or precision and recall, the evaluation of effectiveness has often been the focus of research. While general web search engines play an extremely important role in today's information infrastructure economically, culturally, politically, technically, etc. and have become an integral part of daily life at many levels, information science has only partially embraced the role of general web search engines in society. Research is fragmented into different subfields of information science and these fields do not always communicate well with each other.",
        "In this special issue, we call on information science researchers to join us in the investigation of general web search engines, also from outside Information Retrieval. Information science can look back on a long and rich tradition of studying search and search systems. Relevance, one of the most central concepts for even contemporary search engines, has its origin in the field (Saracevic, 1975). Still, there are some blind spots, especially what role different types of relevance play when it comes to search engines (cf. Sundin, Lewandowski & Haider, 2021). These search engines index a plethora of content and have a very low quality threshold when it comes to including documents in their indexes. Therefore, ranking results in a way that benefits users and at the same time provide societal relevance is paramount.",
        "From a technical viewpoint, information retrieval research has contributed to search engines by developing indexing methods (e.g., Sparck Jones, 1972) and ranking algorithms, with link-based algorithms being based on central ideas from information science, namely citation analysis (Garfield, 1979). Evaluation campaigns such as TREC (Haarman & Voorhees, 2006) and CLEF (Ferro & Peters, 2019) have developed solid methods and procedures to thoroughly test search engines. On the user side, information science research has contributed to the development and understanding of search engines through developing information-seeking models (e.g., Bates, 1989; Kuhlthau, 2003; Belkin, Oddy & Brooks, 1982) that are used in system development (White, 2016).",
        "Information behaviour research has also produced a large body of empirical work on people's behaviour when looking for and using information. Information science, with its rich tradition of studying these topics, provides a good starting point for investigating today's search engines (Haider & Sundin, 2019; Lewandowski, Sünkler & Schultheiß, 2020; Lewandowski et al., 2021). As the field is interdisciplinary, it can also can serve as a hub for integrating research from other fields. Search engines and their use (search) are studied in different disciplines and from different theoretical perspectives. In addition to information science, information studies, and LIS, the topic has been addressed in disciplines as diverse as science and technology studies (STS), media and communication studies, political science, economics, education, psychology, HCI, or informatics, to name a few.",
        "Media-centred and device-centered research exists alongside people-centred studies and research that focuses on society, economics, or politics. While some focus on search engine use in general (e.g., Halavais 2018), others examine specific commercial search engines such as Google (e.g., Hillis et al. 2012), as well as Yandex, Baidu, or various regional services (e.g., Zavadski & Toepfl 2019). Some studies focus on specific groups such as teenagers (e.g., Andersson 2017) or the elderly (Sanchiz et al. 2017), settings, or professions (e.g., Gudmundsdottir and Hartlevik 2020), and others focus on search engine use in relation to other platforms such as social media (e.g., Delmastro & Splendore 2021).",
        "More recently, with the emergence of critical algorithm studies and critical AI, the focus has been on the various ways in which Google in particular may be implicated in society's information disorders and problems with misinformation and algorithmic biases that reinforce prejudice and injustice (e.g., Noble, 2018; Puschmann 2019). Another angle has been the central role of Google in capitalism (Bilić 2018; Mager, 2012), while others have examined the role of commercial search engines in reinforcing confirmation biases, partisanship, or hostile media effects (e.g., Tripodi 2018). Although search engines have been studied from many different angles and for a relatively long time, the field is extremely scattered. Not only is there little awareness of each other's work across disciplines, but even across subfields there are few connections. Different disciplinary investigations run in parallel and rarely meet in a productive way. Furthermore, the more commercial search engines fade into the background, the more difficult it becomes to perceive and study them. Moreover, their functioning is largely opaque and beyond the control of society, which in many cases means that the data available for research remains speculative. This may require creative approaches to data collection and methodology, as well as research designs that are open to new influences and experimental tactics.",
        "This Call for Papers is based on the premise that different approaches need to benefit from each other. We are looking for contributions that broaden the respective disciplinary, methodological, or empirical perspectives to identify and explore commercial search engines and their use and role in society from new angles, or that bring together different approaches in original ways. In particular, we would like to encourage information science/information studies, broadly understood, to reposition themselves and contribute the discipline's expertise to shed light on the ever more powerful role of commercial search engines in almost all areas of society and everyday life, influencing not only how we know and what we know, but increasingly also how knowledge and information are created and communicated, to begin with. The guest-editors welcome papers representing a variety of approaches. Papers can be theoretical, conceptual or empirical or combinations thereof."

      "paragraphs": [
        "This special issue, \"Healthier Information Ecosystems,\" will focus on the interconnected nature of online pathologies, draw attention to the socio-technical aspects of information technology, and animate interdisciplinary approaches to addressing these problems. Similar to Buckminster Fuller’s mission of “World Game,” we want to aid in developing a wide variety of solutions (including but not limited to technical, political, social, and educational) to the wicked problems of our time to make “the world work for 100% of humanity, in the shortest period of time… without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.” We invite contributions that address the socio-cultural embeddedness of the problems plaguing information ecosystems and provide new ways of thinking about and strategies to achieve a healthier global information environment.",
        "We are actively seeking a broad approach to issues of healthier information ecosystems, including both theoretical and applied, qualitative and quantitative, as well as inside and outside the discipline of information science and technology. We are interested in transdisciplinary contributions that move beyond narrow, cross-sectional treatments of online phenomena to highlight the socio-technical dynamics of online spaces framed in cultural-historical contexts. As Rong Tang (Tang et al., 2021) and colleagues mentioned in their 2021 JASIST piece, information science is experiencing a paradigm shift and the need to better understand the socio-technical side of information technology is central to this change.",
        "There is no shortage of research examining the pathological aspects of our modern information ecosystems, covering a broad spectrum of socio-technical phenomena including (but not limited to) misinformation, toxicity, polarization, and extremism. Together, these phenomena might be considered to be a sign of an “unhealthy” information ecosystem. However, our collective understanding of the problem remains fragmented and incomplete, impeding our ability to identify and implement successful solutions.",
        "For this special issue, we seek papers that take an interdisciplinary approach to expanding our understanding of information ecosystems by answering such vital questions as: What does it mean to live in an unhealthy information ecosystem, is it possible to envision a healthier one, and how do we get from here to there? While many of the problems in online settings have been examined in isolation, they are often intimately connected—each problem can be both cause and consequence of the others. For instance, toxic online content is made even more virulent by bogus claims and misinformation that is amplified by social media’s and search engines’ network infrastructure.",
        "Misinformation (and disinformation) can inflame conspiracy theories that demonize outgroups and reinforce social identity dynamics, driving further polarization and paving the way for toxic online cultures. We adopt an ecosystems framing to highlight such interconnectedness. The problems that now occupy many researchers’ work emerge from complex, technologically mediated networks and interconnected systems of people, institutions, and cultures that create, spread, organize, and amplify information. This complex system is a rich avenue for inquiry by the research community, but focusing on isolated aspects while neglecting their interrelationships will miss systemic opportunities to intervene.",
        "Moreover, problems like misinformation, toxicity, and polarization are influenced by contextual factors including social norms, economics, power structures, and worldviews. If we fail to examine information science and technology against this backdrop, stakeholders inside and outside of the academy are unlikely to identify realistic strategies for improving information ecosystems.",
        "We are eager to receive contributions from disciplines that might lend new perspectives, including (but not limited to) statistical physics, complex systems, biology, environmental science, economics, management science, organization science, communication, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy. All contributions should clarify how they can be used to help our information ecosystems work for the betterment of society at large, developing an inclusive and thus “healthy” ecosystem."

      "paragraphs": [
        "The rise of information technology (IT) in organizations has been an inherent part of an agenda to increase and shape forms of social control. Despite the inherent link between uses of IT and social control, the topic of regulation has not received significant attention in the information system field – neither theoretically nor empirically. This special seeks to address this gap. The issue explores the growing and significant interplay between IT and regulation in the age of digitalization, where new challenges with social control with IT are emerging.",
        "In this special issue, we are interested in two broad domains of research related to regulation and IT: regulation through IT and regulation of IT. The first domain – regulation through IT – concerns new forms and arenas of regulation enacted through innovative IT solutions (often called “RegTech”). These technologies which are increasingly implicated in regulatory practices include new forms of real-time big data analytics, machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, use of blockchains and distributed ledgers, Internet of Things solutions or natural language processing techniques. These technologies change the ways organizations and industrial sectors respond to and comply with a growing number of regulatory obligations and needs. These technologies are also driving changes in the ways in which regulators seek to supervise and monitor firms and the ways in which firms comply with laws and regulations. Greater market and organizational transparency and enhanced supervision are now advocated as critical responses to organizational misconduct and associated risks. This has resulted in an increasing call for bureaucratization and (over-)regulation. Call for greater monitoring, supervision and sanctioning have been driven by concerns regarding the environment, health and safety risks, corporate fiscal and fiduciary scandals, financial failures leading to financial crisis in 2007-2008, or growing violations of data privacy increased the “volume, velocity and variety” of laws and regulations that organizations must comply with and the range of novel IT based solutions they need to comply to such demands. Regulators have also shown a growing appetite to measure performance, to quantify financial, regulatory and operational risk and to improve compliance reporting through new technologies that assign accountability, enforce security and behavioural control, automate monitor and enhance record keeping.",
        "The second domain – regulation of IT – is the wide range deployment and associated regulatory effects of new IT (esp. concerns of security, privacy and/or safety). There is a notable gap in the field’s knowledge regarding new demands and ways of regulating IT given its scale, complexity and pervasive use. Concerns regarding the pervasive effects of platform businesses on privacy, competition and information veracity have invited calls to control and scrutinize technology vendors. Similar issues are likely to emerge in autonomous cars, user-based insurance, health policies and so on. There are consequently increased demands to regulate various IT solutions and to increase regulatory powers of governments related to IT uses, including through introducing entirely new regulatory bodies. If platform providers and vendors, or organizations offering extensive algorithmic solutions as parts of their related services, are subjected to new regulatory structures, then important questions arise regarding what degrees of transparency and reporting are appropriate and how related forms of supervision and sanctioning would function that need to regulate actual systems and their functioning and those who are implicated in their design.",
        "We invite empirical and theoretical research that contribute to our understanding and application how regulation is enacted through IT or how uses of IT can be regulated. We encourage submissions that use diverse epistemological and methodological approaches to focus on emerging and new regulatory solutions and practices. Submissions may engage in cross-disciplinary inquiries and should offer novel knowledge and fresh methodological, theoretical and empirical insights how regulation and IT evolve and are related. The papers will be evaluated for their interestingness, novelty and credibility of the contribution. If in doubt, interested authors should consult the special issue guest editors whether their papers fall within the scope of the special issue. To this end, authors are encouraged to submit an extended abstract to the editors for initial feedback."

      "paragraphs": [
        "The last decade has seen a significant proliferation of new technologies. These include robotic process automation, big data, machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain and other emerging technologies. Consulting and market research companies have consistently predicted that the current wave of technologies will transform both front and back office operations, requiring firms to rethink their business models and strategies.",
        "While evidence suggests that firms will continue to invest in emerging technologies, there has so far been little evidence about the involvement of service providers and advisory in the selection, design and adoption of such emerging technologies. IS sourcing research has conventionally accounted for three main areas of interest: sourcing decision, contractual structures and relationship management. Emerging technologies challenge these traditional conventions in the IS sourcing literature.",
        "Particular challenges include but are not limited to: There is greater dependency on data in emerging technologies, which triggers clients to source data science services; the actual implementation of emerging technology often happens through platforms that involve multiple players and services; the asset transfer model has become less relevant and yet client firms are still expected to reduce their headcount; there is greater emphasis on the redesign of the value chain as services have become digitized; and decisions are now driven by smart algorithms. At the same time, emerging technologies are viewed as a black box, posing a skills and expertise challenge to client firms to ensure acquiring and retaining knowledge of the technology.",
        "Further, the IS sourcing literature which has traditionally relied on three main reference theories, namely, transaction cost economics, resource dependency and social exchange. Emerging technologies emphasize the need of expanding this theoretical base and accommodating new paradigms of capturing and analysing data in IS sourcing research.",
        "Taking into account the above observations, the IS sourcing literature thus begs for the reexamination of client-supplier-advisory relationships by challenging core concepts of sourcing decision, contractual structure and relationship management as offering new theoretical landscapes that accommodate the sourcing phenomenon in a digital age. This special issue seeks to facilitate an empirical and theoretical re-examination of IS sourcing in the light of the current wave of emerging technologies. The authors are invited to submit research papers that investigate issues relating to emerging technologies and IS sourcing, in particular issues concerning robotic process automation, big data, machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence and blockchain. Other technologies are less of interest for this special issue."

        "Disruptive digital innovations do not come without pain – the disorder that they introduce can create negative externalities and unintended consequences for people, communities, industries and economies. In the worst case, there is disruption with little innovation. This can lead to job losses for individuals, loss of human dignity, negative health impacts, lost revenue for communities, obsolescence of industries and loss of the traditional values that underpin modern societies.",
        "Sarker et al. (2019) note that “humanistic concerns arising from the curtailing of human freedom and development, and from racism, sexism and commodification of the human body are overlooked for the apparent benefits that systems, including widely used search engines and medical databases, promise to deliver (Noble 2018; Wachter-Boettcher 2017). Indeed, there is a rising need for a thorough ethical interrogation of algorithms (O’Neil 2016) that underlie systems mediating many critical human activities, so as not to marginalize certain stakeholders, especially those ‘who are already in the margin’ (Noble 2018, p. 171).",
        "In this special issue, we take this critical, yet constructive view of technological and social changes associated with 'digital transformation' (Zuboff 2015, Wood et al. 2019, Larsson and Teigland 2020). We are interested in contrarian papers that reject the taken-for-granted assumptions of positive impacts of technology, as in cases of digital platforms, telework enabled by mobility, growth of the gig economy, fintech/blockchain, and so on, and investigate relatively unexamined platform externalities as a means to identify ways to resolve paradoxes, discontinuities and challenges posed by technology and the unintended consequences of technology applications.",
        "We also seek papers that shed light on the problems of information technology (IT)-enabled phenomena such as the implications of winner-takes-all platform economics; highlight the social, environmental and economic implications of blockchain and similar innovative digital technologies; or propose solutions that mitigate negative societal impacts of innovation (e.g., through leveraging the power of social networks to disseminate information and strengthen democratic discourse).",
        "We encourage the submission of manuscripts taking either of two stances: 1) Submissions considering a critical or dystopian view of the social, technological and moral implications of digitization and digital transformation. Here, 'the dark side' – ethical issues, unintended digitalization and other problematic aspects – of digitalization and platformization are front and centre the argument. An example may be Zuboff’s (2015, 2019) recent work on surveillance capitalism and her analyses of large-scale digitization 'gone wrong'. 2) Submissions seeking to balance or reconcile 'the dark side' and 'the bright side' of digitalization and platformization. Here, analyses, exemplars and theoretical frameworks considered ethical issues and negative consequences explicitly, in addition to intended benefits of digitalization too often exclusively focused on. An example may be social media research: initial writings trumpeted the benefits of social media for building relationships, with later work highlighting problematic behaviours such as cyberbullying or doxxing.",
        "In this special issue, we are open to all forms of inquiry, including surveys, experiments, case studies, design science projects and conceptual work that probe 'the dark side', ethical issues and unintended consequences of digitization, platformization and the rapid diffusion of digital infrastructures and digital work models based thereon."

        "Theorizing is one of the defining aspects of academic research. Articulating insights generated from situated empirical observations into relatively stable abstractions (e.g., concepts, propositions, models) that elucidate, explain or predict events occurring at another time and place is the hallmark of knowledge generation (King 2021). Of late, much attention has been paid to theory development in the Information Systems (IS) field. For example, the MIS Quarterly (MISQ) special issue on 'Next-Generation Information Systems Theorizing' reflects a sense of urgency felt within the IS field to make sense of an increasingly unruly and complex reality given the increasing pace of technological innovation (Burton-Jones et al. 2021). In similar vein, two 2021 Journal of Information Technology (JIT) debates sections focused on 'IS Research and Science' (Siponen and Klaavuniemi 2020, and commentaries) and 'Theorising as Craft' (Rivard 2021, and commentaries) and a recent Journal of the Association for Information System’s (JAIS) special issue focused on 'Envisioning Digital Transformation–Advancing Theoretical Diversity'. New and native IS theories ensure that the IS field remains vibrant, diverse, academically and socially relevant and influential (Hassan 2011; Hassan and Willcocks 2021; Lowry et al. 2020; Markus and Saunders 2007).",
        "Researchers, however, often set the bar too high for theory delivered within individual research contributions by viewing theory as a comprehensive and detailed explanation of a phenomenon (Rivard 2021), an object that Weick (1995) refers to as a 'theory that sweeps away all others' (p. 386). This mindset may lead IS researchers to adopt theories from other fields as a foundation rather than creatively developing new and native theories from empirical observations (Grover and Lyytinen 2015).",
        "To maintain the long-term growth and vitality of the IS field, a definition of theory that encourages cumulative and novel theorizing over time is needed (Hassan and Willcocks 2021; King 2021). One way of achieving this is by advancing a 'products of theorising' perspective (Weick 1995). The theorising perspective celebrates both the final outcomes and the 'interim struggles' that characterize theory generation (Weick 1995). It holds the promise that interim conceptual artefacts of theorizing such as metaphors, frameworks and concepts (Lowry et al. 2020) are valuable to the discipline as they can be leveraged and exploited further in subsequent research. In this way, a discipline might inch its way towards native theories over time.",
        "The goal of this special issue is to solicit and showcase exemplars from the 'products of theorizing' approach. We are looking for articles that go beyond verification dimensions of the natural-science approach to IS research (Schlagwein 2021) and push the envelope of theorizing towards native products of theorizing (Hassan et al. (forthcoming): theory frame devices (i.e., questions, paradigms, laws and frameworks), theory generators (i.e., myths, analogies, metaphors and models) and theory components (i.e., concepts, constructs, statements and hypotheses). The time is ripe to embark upon the development of native theories in the IS field, as IT has leaped into the consciousness of the public in unprecedented ways.",
        "To take advantage of the theorizing opportunities that these emergent information technology (IT) phenomena provide, the goal of this special issue is to encourage research that generates products of theorizing derived from and related to IT phenomena. We are seeking contributions that develop products of theorizing, that is, interim constructions, that are useful as precursors to strong native IS theory. To increase the likelihood of a theorizing product’s value, we are particularly interested in research that tackles phenomena that are core to the IS discipline. Given the multifaceted nature of the IS discipline, we do not expect agreement on what constitutes a core IS phenomenon. We therefore encourage authors to make the case that the products of theorizing they develop are valuable for articulating native theories that are defining of the field of IS or are substantially valuable for their specific area."

        "This special issue focuses on the currently ongoing – and recently COVID19 accelerated – digital transformation(s) of economy and society. That is, how industry sectors and societal domains are reshaped by the geo-political, organizational and technological nexus that is 'digital transformation'. The literature on digital transformation is interdisciplinary, spanning fields such as information systems (Vial, 2019), management (Hanelt et al., 2021) and other business disciplines (Verhoef et al., 2021). However, this work's broad range and somewhat incoherent framings show a lack of consensus of 'digital transformation' as both a theoretical concept and an empirical field (Warner and Wager, 2019). Thus far, most digital transformation studies have focused on the organization as the unit of analysis. Why a single definition of digital transformation may be elusive, the digital transformation seems most often used to as a just a shorthand for IT-enabled organizational transformation (Besson and Rowe, 2012; Wessel et al, 2020), an organization-centric approach.",
        "Digital transformation processes increasingly take place at wider scales, beyond individual organizations and their business processes. Digital transformation(s) affect financial markets (Currie et al., 2018), healthcare (Pouloudi et al., 2016) or government (Weerakkody et al., 2016). Digital transformation(s) hence often have disruptive effects in relation to industry structures, corporate strategy, consumer experiences, policies and overall economic and societal trajectories (Legner et al., 2017; Zuboff, 2015; Vial, 2019). In this special issue, we invite especially that a) study digital transformation as a process (preferred over simplistic 'cause-and-effect' hypotheses), and b) understand digital transformation in a broad sense, that is, in relation to industries, governments, economies and societies (preferred over organization-centric approaches).",
        "We are interested in work that understands digital transformation as a process. Studies of interest may use process theories, process analyses and/or process data to provide explanations (Langley, 1999). Process studies offer a means of conceptualizing events and identifying patterns (Gehman et al., 2018). These aspects have often been neglected in IS studies in favour of simplistic variance models (Karpovsky and Galliers 2015). Approaching digital transformation fundamentally as a process promises to produce theoretical accounts with nuanced explanations of change (Weick and Quinn, 1999). Variance models (and other types of models) are also welcomed to the special issue. Still, they will be expected to pay attention to digital transformation as a process and not to neglect the relevant processual patterns or temporal order.",
        "We are interested in work that studies digital transformation in a broad sense. Such work may see digital transformation as a nexus of technological, organizational, industrial, economic, governmental, societal and geo-political changes. This nexus invites theoretical and empirical studies which extend organization-centric views to understanding wider processes in which digital IT plays a key role. Emerging IT (artificial intelligence and machine learning, robotics and automation, blockchains and cryptocurrencies, meta-verses, remote working technologies, etc.) may generate specific opportunities for such research. Digital transformations come with significant challenges for businesses and societies, governments, and regulators across jurisdictions. Organization-centric approaches are welcomed to the special issue but must pay attention to wider developments and contexts and argue why the organization is the best locus of study. In preparing papers for this special issue, authors are expected to engage with the concept of digital transformation as a process and provide critical theoretical and/or empirical analysis extending beyond IT-driven change of isolated business processes."

        "This special issue is interested in 'next-generation' research methods for studying information technology (IT) phenomena – particularly in the information system (IS) research field. So far, IS researchers have applied a range of quantitative, qualitative and engaged methods to study IT-related phenomena. Quantitative IS research has often followed a positivist approach of hypothesis testing, with sometimes 'first-generation' regression models distinguished from 'second-generation' structural equation models (Gerow et al. 2011). Data used in such methods stems from surveys, experiments, panel studies, etc. The primary objective of this research stream typically is theory testing. Qualitative IS research has ranged from positivist to interpretivist, seeking rich situated insights via case studies, grounded theory or ethnographies. One objective of this research stream is theory construction. Critical and emancipatory IS research adds a strong value orientation and theoretical basis to qualitative research. Another type of IS research seeks to generate new knowledge with 'engaged' methods like design science or action research. The objective of this stream that differentiates it from the first two is the focus on solving important individual, organizational or societal challenges; or extending the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts (Baskerville and Wood-Harper 1996; Hevner et al. 2004).",
        "In recent years, the scope of and possibilities for IS research have tremendously widened. Digital IT have become mainstream at the individual, organizational and societal levels (Burton-Jones et al. 2021). Digital IT is key to innovation in various domains from medicine to education, from psychology to the arts. Hence, these domains have become of interest and relevance to IS researchers, yet also overlap with other fields and are hence interdisciplinary in nature. These innovations are increasing the volume and variety of trace data available to researchers but necessitate a shift in our research practices (Johnson et al. 2019). Further, big data, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies provide a plethora of powerful approaches for collecting and analysing data at a scale not possible before such that we might need to adapt our research methods and tools to make this data actionable and to generate novel knowledge.",
        "These ML technologies are being applied not only to theory testing but also to theory construction in conjunction with or independent of qualitative methods (Miranda et al. 2022). This special issue focuses on the next generation of research methods to study IT – new methods relevant to the IS research field that account for a) the interdisciplinary nature and wider scope of IT phenomena, and/or b) the novel capacities afforded by new technologies/techniques (e.g., ML/AI). The way that novel technologies and techniques afford new possibilities is quite apparent in quantitative IS research. In contrast to 'first-generation' regression-based approaches and 'second-generation' structural equation modelling, a new generation of research methods including the predictive analytics (Shmueli and Koppius 2011), data mining (Smith 2020), ML (Shrestha et al. 2020) or explainable AI (Gunning et al. 2019) come with substantial new opportunities and challenges.",
        "For instance, these methods potentially allow for more fine-grained measurements and analyses to extend our knowledge of existing phenomena and may help us study novel phenomena including those that were, methodologically speaking, 'out of reach' (George et al. 2016). These technological advancements enable us to progress our research toolkit and inform new ways of generating knowledge and theorizing (Burton-Jones et al. 2021; Shrestha et al. 2020). Increased recognition of abduction as a counterpart to deductive and inductive reasoning (Behfar and Okhuysen 2018; Sætre and Van de Ven 2021) pits concerns about practices such as HARKing (Kerr 1998) – hypothesizing after the results are known (aka p-hacking) – believed to lead to logically and scientifically flawed hypotheses, against concerns about stifling the advancement of knowledge (Pratt et al. 2019). ML/AI techniques are now so powerful that they can test millions of models on large data sets to find the 'best-matching' model (of all possible) for what needs to be explained. This is a fundamental gear change in what can be done with quantitative data sets, the promise and validity of which are hotly debated (Kitchin 2014; Smith 2020).",
        "In terms of changes to the nature of the IS domains, qualitative-interpretative researchers seek to find new methods suitable for the wider, interdisciplinary scope of IS research. This is done via finding or developing analytical new grounds and looking at digital IT differently (e.g. via sociomaterial or affordances perspectives), seeking additional foundations in other fields (e.g., Zuboff's (2015) political economy informed analysis of surveillance capitalism and 'Big Tech') or via the modification of methods to suit digital environments (e.g., virtual ethnographies or computational grounded theory). Other forms of qualitative research such as meta-synthesis, qualitative comparative analysis and discourse analysis also seem promising and relevant but are seldomly used in IS research.",
        "Digital IT (e.g., social media, digital platforms, AI/ML) has increasing and substantial impacts on society (e.g., mental health, trust in science, misinformation and polarization, monopolization and industry disruption). Hence, ethical, critical, value-based and political-economy questions are increasingly and necessarily asked about digital IT. Similarly, today‘s pace of innovation may also warrant novel approaches to engaged scholarship and design science. For instance, researchers are calling for methods that can accumulate and update evidence more effectively (Lacity et al. 2021) and better ensure the generalizability of prescriptive knowledge (Brendel et al. 2021; Iivari et al. 2021).",
        "This special issue invites contributions that propose, introduce, debate or critique novel quantitative, qualitative or design-oriented methods research, with a focus on the 'how' (i.e., origins, processes, steps of the method) and the 'why' (e.g., 'rigour vs relevance' and 'it is new, but is it better' questions) these approaches should be used in IS research. The goal of the special issue is to provide a space for introducing and discussing innovative 'next-generation' methods for studying IT-related phenomena, relative to the IS research field."

        "This special issue seeks to explore and extend the conceptualisation, design, development, implementation and governance of contemporary “decentralised” information systems.",
        "“Decentralised” information systems are often seen as an important anti-thesis to “centralised” such systems. Modern societies and economies rely more highly on data, information systems, and technologies than ever. Pioneering organisations brought forth major milestones in developing and providing information technologies (e.g., TCP/IP and the Internet). However, with the significance of information technology increasing over the past decades, a small number of organisations have emerged as “tech giants” (e.g., Alphabet/Google or Meta/Facebook). Those organisations offer digital services and infrastructures for data processing that gained large-scale adoption by individuals, organisations, governments and society at large. As a result, societies, economies and technical systems became strongly dependent on services from a handful of organisations.",
        "The increase of the resulting dependencies leads to a centralisation of information systems. Highly-centralised information systems can result in global organisations and central social actors that abuse their power and pursue their own interests at the expense of others or exclude participation from social actors who disagree with them or invade their privacy through monitoring. Highly-centralised information systems can also pose several further risks. For example, governance rights– such as rights of access, validation, software updates, data policies, and data overrides— may be centralised with few social actors in control.",
        "To avert risks of over-centralization, the purposeful decentralisation of information systems has become a prominent topic of public discourse, for example, around Internet search, cloud computing, social media and financial systems. An information system’s degree of decentralisation refers to the degree to which the information system is independent of central actors and technical constructs. Several attempts have been made to design decentralised information systems to improve collaboration between actors while reducing dependencies on central authorities. Such endeavours include the development of decentralised token economies based on distributed ledger technology, decentralised identity management systems and distributed collaborative machine learning systems.",
        "Although information systems decentralisation may resolve several of the above issues of over-centralization, it also comes with its own challenges. For example, maintaining decentralised information systems can become difficult when multiple social actors need to update their technical components independently. Extensive data replication across technical components in decentralised information systems can facilitate detecting and exploiting software vulnerabilities. If too many social actors have opposing ideas, decentralised governance risks never reaching an agreement. When only a few social actors participate in governance, information systems envisioned to be decentralised may de facto centralise.",
        "To purposefully achieve the benefits of information system decentralisation, we need to consider both the design of information systems as such and the behaviour of the social actors involved. Information systems decentralisation is driven by interdepended economic, political, social and technical factors. Changes to corporate information system designs, corporate ecosystems, and regulatory refinements are required to facilitate the development and adoption of such technical innovations. Such changes can lead to the centralisation of information systems in other aspects, such as their organisational structures. The entanglement of interdisciplinary factors tightly makes information systems decentralisation an interdisciplinary topic, relevant to several research fields, including computer science, organisational studies and information systems. The interdependence between information system designs and the influence of interdisciplinary factors makes the purposeful decentralisation of information systems an important yet complex undertaking that this special issue seeks new knowledge about.",
        "The complexity of information system decentralisation leads to various open questions, such as “how to achieve and sustain appropriate degrees of decentralisation of information systems so that individuals, organisations, and entire business ecosystems can benefit”, “how decentralised enterprise information systems need to be designed”, and “what technical know-how and involvement is required from actors to decentralise information systems appropriately”?",
        "This special issue seeks to improve the understanding of how the various factors affect the decentralisation of information systems used in business and other societal contexts, how different degrees of decentralisation of such information systems emerge over time, and how different degrees of decentralisation of information systems can affect business ecosystems, business processes, and societies overall. We invite applied, empirical, and theoretical research works that investigate information system decentralisation in a way that acknowledges its inter-disciplinary nature and significantly contributes to understanding information system decentralisation, its manifestations, antecedents, and its impact on individuals and organisations, ecosystems and societies. We welcome and encourage submissions from researchers using diverse epistemological and methodological approaches. The manuscripts will be evaluated for the interestingness and novelty of their contributions."

        "JMIS, a top-tier scholarly journal, invites the best papers addressing the components of the potential emergence of the Metaverse as a complement to and a potential replacement for the current Web.",
        "The Metaverse is envisioned as a collection of technologies and initiatives intended to create a nextgeneration Internet (Web3) that is highly immersive, persistent, in 3D, and based on the latest developments in extended reality (XR)—an umbrella term for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR)—as supplemented by artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, quantum computing, and other supporting technologies. Given the compelling and disruptive potential for the Metaverse to generate the Web3, several of the world’s leading technology companies are investing tens of billions of dollars on related software and hardware to foster this market, including Meta (famously renamed from “Facebook” as an all-in bet on the Metaverse), Microsoft, Snapchat, Amazon, NVIDIA, Epic Games, Apple, among others.",
        "This is an opportune time for researchers to examine what can be learned from the past failed efforts of AR/VR platforms such as Second Life and over-hyped failed AR technologies like Google Glass, and to examine the many more successes that are occurring, perhaps more quietly, with XR (i.e., VR, MR, AR) in education, manufacturing, gaming, branding, healthcare, retailing, logistics, aerospace and defense, architecture, advertising, and athletics. It is these successes and disruptive business models that are likely to form what will be known as the Metaverse. However, this is no minor feat, just as the Internet as we know it took decades to develop. To create a truly persistent 3D, virtual, and immersive Metaverse, there will need to be further advances in supporting hardware (goggles, headsets, sensors), and an exponential increase in computing power, storage, and memory. If the Metaverse is to succeed it must be based on making things better for people than the status quo, and thus must foster innovative business models that are profitable, and yet foster interoperability, efficiency, remote work, reliability, fairness, accountability, open governance, inclusivity, safety, community, and to do so in a manner that is sustainable environmentally, socially and ethically.",
        "This is the time for scientists to work with policy makers, companies, and not-for-profit organizations to break the current social media models and envision a Metaverse that can best serve collective global needs.",
        "Accordingly, we are pleased to announce a Special Issue (SI) on this subject at JMIS. Importantly, information systems (IS) researchers have long contributed to the foundational research that can serve as building blocks for the Metaverse, including but not limited to XR (i.e., VR, AR, MR), avatars, agents, gamification, and gaming. Meanwhile, IS researchers are presently leading key research on the Metaverse itself. Our strong preference is for contributions of original and rigorous theory-guided behavioral or empirical data around information systems artifacts that inform design, practice, research, and the products and foundations of theory of meaningful aspects of the Metaverse. We seek any methodological approaches that are legitimate and rigorous, and that can shed light on important phenomena related to the Metaverse. However, we are not seeking review papers or those that focus on discussions of further research alone."

        "Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and others are a growing epidemic facing modern society. The Mental Health America society estimated that nearly a fifth of the adult US population suffered a mental illness in 2019-2020 and that 94% of these individuals did not receive any treatment. Information Technology (IT) such as wearables, digital pills, cope notes, VR, and others have been proposed and used to help address the growing mental health crisis. However, the understanding of the design, development, adoption, use, and impact of such technologies for diagnosing and treating mental health illnesses remains nascent.",
        "Information Systems (IS) scholars are starting to study various aspects of mental health, including occupational stress, distress, and diagnosable mental health disorders. However, significant areas of opportunity remain for developing and evaluating digital technologies that could help identify or tackle anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, panic, social anxiety), mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), and addiction (e.g., substance abuse, chemical dependence). This Special Section seeks to expand research related to IT for mental health and spearhead an ongoing research agenda related to this subject in the IS discipline. We are specifically seeking contributions that improve our understanding of how IT could be leveraged to identify mental health conditions and improve mental health. We encourage a wide range of content, including theory, qualitative and quantitative approaches, and design science for mental health for this Special Section.",
        "Irrespective of the topic, the focus on how IT is being used or developed to identify mental health conditions or improve mental health should be evident. Research that examines the negative impacts of technology (e.g., antecedents to technostress) do not fit the theme. We welcome research that uses or employs various types of methods and analysis, including qualitative methods, quantitative methods, archival and observational research methods, mixed methods research, design science research, and AI-enabled analytics methods, including machine learning, deep learning, text mining, and network science."

        "Generative AI, which refers to artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that generate original outputs based on prompt inputs, has the potential to fundamentally transform the way people create and consume content online. Unlike previous generations of AI systems, which were primarily designed to recognize patterns and make predictions, Generative AI synthesizes the data it has been trained on and creates content in the form of images, text, audio, video, and more that is similar to content created by human experts – but in much less time, at a fraction of the cost, and with amazing creativity.",
        "In this special issue, we focus on the opportunities and challenges that Generative AI poses for digital platforms. Over the past two decades, social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube, mobile app platforms such as Apple’s App Store, e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, freelance platforms such as Upwork, and sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb and Uber have reshaped and disrupted entire industries. What these platform companies have in common is that they create value by facilitating interactions and the exchange of goods and services between two or more groups that would have been difficult or impossible to connect in the absence of the platform.",
        "IS researchers have contributed important insights on fundamental questions regarding the implications of AI for business as well as how the technology could and should be managed. However, with the emergence of Generative AI, new research avenues are opening up, providing an opportunity for IS scholars to conduct leading research on the transformative and value-creating capacity of this fascinating technology, especially with regard to digital platforms. As a disruptive technology, Generative AI can enable truly innovative services and business models that engage all platform stakeholders in unprecedented ways. Despite this promise as a game changer, the interplay between the Generative AI’s inherent potential and its transformative value for digital platforms is poorly understood and requires further research. This is an area where IS scholars are well-equipped to contribute to the discussion through cutting-edge research.",
        "Rather than addressing the operational and tactical merits of Generative AI, this special issue provides a dedicated forum for IS and other scholars to engage in an important dialogue on its strategic and managerial implications. In particular, we are interested in the transformative value of Generative AI for digital platforms and the impact of Generative AI on the various stakeholders in a digital platform ecosystem, including complementors, users, and platform providers."

        "An irony of science is that, despite our devotion to evidence, there is little evidence underpinning many aspects of the journal review process. As part of our commitment to continually improving our review processes at MIS Quarterly, this special issue aims to obtain evidence regarding the merits of a recent innovation in the review process—registered reports.",
        "While the registered report model is relatively new, it has been adopted by over 200 journals across the sciences. Business and Information Systems Engineering was the first (and so far, lone) IS journal to adopt this model. Other early adopters across the business fields include Journal of Accounting Research (JAR), Academy of Management Discoveries, and Leadership Quarterly.",
        "Our goal in this special issue is to learn if the registered report model should be available as an ongoing model for MISQ, as a supplement to our existing options. While we see a lot of promise in the model, we plan to test it first to learn if/how it can best suit our journal.",
        "As figure 1 shows, the registered report model involves a 2-stage ‘acceptance’ process: a conditional acceptance before data collection, followed by an acceptance if the authors follow the agreed plan.",
        "Please note that registered reports are not the same as ‘pre-registrations.’ Pre-registrations refer to the activity of registering one’s hypotheses (and other details) prior to testing them. Registered reports go a step further than pre-registrations in that the paper is submitted to the journal before the final data has even been collected.",
        "Early tests of the registered report model across the sciences are yielding positive results, especially on the dimensions of bias reduction and investment motivation.",
        "Submissions to this special issue will be reviewed in a three-step process. Each step will focus on different criteria. The senior editors will examine the submission to ensure it matches the criteria for suitability, which include whether the paper follows a hypothetico-deductive model of science and if it is likely to benefit from a registered report model compared to a regular peer-review process.",
        "Proposals will be screened by the Special Issue Senior Editor and up to one guest Associate Editor from the current MISQ Editorial Board based on topic, theory, and method expertise. The Special Issue Senior Editors will seek to identify up to 30 papers with the remaining papers desk rejected."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Over the last 20 years, ongoing waves of digitalization have decimated the traditional business model of the news and fundamentally changed how the news, or more formally, the ‘institutional press’, works. Indeed, ever since reserved frequencies were gifted to television broadcasters in the 1950s, on the condition that they inform the public of current events, the subsidy underpinning newspapers and other forms of institutional media has slowly eroded. Like many other industries, the internet has accelerated this phenomenon. Not only has the hyper-targeted advertising facilitated by social media and other platforms functionally eroded the subsidy model to its breaking point, but the costless transmission of data facilitated by the internet has increased geographic scope of dominant players permitting them to reach beyond their original markets and squeeze content producers across the globe. Against this backdrop, it is hard to overstate the importance of this “crisis of the institutional press.” The news provides our primary means for understanding the world around us. Societies desperately need a well-functioning institutional press to tackle the many societal, economic, and environmental challenges we all face.",
        "The first day of core MIS undergraduate or MS/MBA classes usually begins with one of four motivating examples: the decline of incumbent sellers in favor of digital platforms, the increasing irrelevance of diseconomies of scale and the rise of digital monopolies, the rise of social media and user generated content, or the decline of the newspaper industry. Yet, as these classes continue to discuss the opportunities firms have in the digital age, the decline of institutional media often fades into the background. This phenomenon-driven special issue is motivated by the view that our students, colleagues, and society urgently need a better understanding of the causes and consequences of the changing nature of news in the digital era and potential solutions going forward. The special issue takes an interdisciplinary perspective, bringing together insights from across the broader information, managerial, and organizational sciences.",
        "This failure to discuss the implications of the decline of institutional news media is troubling. Not only has the Fourth Estate historically served to counterbalance institutions with a monopoly on force and morality, it has been a cornerstone of democratic republics for centuries. In the United States, James Madison declared the free press as “the only effectual guardian of every other right.” In the balance, Western Marxists criticized the singular power of institutional media, seeing it as an instrument for ideological control.",
        "These claims are not idle musings. News media outlets have been shown to influence many societal outcomes, from government agendas, to public opinion, to voting behavior. The Fourth Estate mediates the attention granted to social movements and can influence the strategic management of organizations. Institutional media can also prompt changes in corporate governance, shape the valuation of firms at IPO, influence firm founding, confer legitimacy on industries, and elevate de novo technological innovations in the public consciousness.",
        "Yet, seismic changes have assaulted the free press as we understand it. The late 20th century witnessed an increasing concentration in ownership of news outlets, leading to elevated reliance on advertising revenue that biased content. The recent history of the institutional press is interwoven with the history of digital technology. Initially, the World Wide Web served largely as a vehicle for the dissemination of news produced by professional news organizations, extending their reach. In time, the ensuing competition for reader attention shifted the gatekeeping function previously served by professional news organizations to portals – or online content curators. Contemporary media coverage became more selective and influenced by market actors. With the advent of social media, user-generated content further usurped the gatekeeping role of professional news organizations, specifically that of their journalists whose work was governed by professional norms and practices. Moreover, public subsidy for the Fourth Estate was undermined by social media, accelerating the control of dominant players on public discourse and hollowing the local publishing industry, subverting attention to local political issues and increasing economic agents’ willingness to contravene state and federal law. At the same time, social media has afforded citizen journalists the ability to counter-balance the biases of professional news organizations.",
        "Even more recently, society has witnessed a demonstrable shift towards the “post-truth era,” in which populist, tribalist, and anti- “mainstream media” rhetoric proliferates. Scholarship suggests that such rhetoric serves to further undermine public confidence in the institutional press, pushing large portions of the populace towards alternate media that eschew journalistic norms and evidence-based reporting. While the blockchain has been heralded as a way of remaking the institutional press in the digital era, we have little systematic understanding of its efficacy. The long-term implications of these AI tools on the institutional press are unknown. We are witnessing intersections of the evolutionary paths of technology and the institutional press in ways that are fundamentally changing the “freedom of the press” and the complex network that includes journalists, software engineers, relational databases, and social media platforms which form it, along with prevailing norms, values, and institutional logics of a particular sociotechnical moment.",
        "Research has only begun to address these changes. The purpose of this Special Issue is to address this gap in scholarship head on and to inform stakeholders such as media managers, social planners, legislators, trade associations, regulators, and journalists about how changes in institutional media are affecting society at the intersection of business, technology, and public policy. To this end, we invite scholarship that helps academia and society comprehend the major changes taking place within the institutional press, why those changes are occurring, and what the consequences of those changes are, and work together toward a more positive future for the institutional press."

        "Digital threats continue to impede information assurance. Many issues in information assurance have arisen in the last decade or two, including risk management, information quality, intellectual property, privacy protection, compliance with regulations, and continuity of operations (Mahmood et al., 2010; Forrest, 2023). As a result, protecting information has become a global priority, and collaborative efforts are being made to prevent, detect, and react to threats to information quality, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability (European Parliament, 2018; White House, 2023a). As society steps into the age of generative AI (GenAI) (Dennehy et. al., 2023), fresh challenges and opportunities are arising in the realms of information security, privacy, and quality. Questions have emerged regarding the role and intended/unintended consequences of GenAI in information assurance. GenAI is believed to pose a paradox, serving as a dual-edged sword in the realm of information assurance (Robidoux, 2024).",
        "GenAI creates new content, whereas traditional AI mostly makes predictions and classifications based on existing datasets. GenAI is designed to reason and operate independently across various domains, whereas traditional AI focuses on narrow tasks (e.g., playing chess and translating languages by following specific rules). In addition, GenAI works with multiple data modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos), whereas traditional AI primarily functions in a single mode of data. These new capabilities of GenAI open new possibilities for its applications in a wide range of areas. GenAI models can range from generalized models to domain-specific models that automate tasks and generate content adhering to industry-specific terminologies, context-specialized knowledge, and tailored experiences. Its power has sparked discussions on ethics and societal questions regarding the potential impact on employment, bias, privacy, and human-AI relationships.",
        "The emergence of GenAI is poised to exert a profound impact on assurance (Barrett et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). On the one hand, GenAI has been recognized for its ability to bolster information assurance. The IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) commented that GenAI has the potential to strengthen business defenses, accelerate security processes, and identify emerging threats as they arise. Studies have also noted that GenAI may be able to address information management challenges, including quality (Bhatti, 2024). On the other hand, GenAI heightens the potency of existing threats, allows the fabrication of false information, fuels intellectual property theft, and poses challenges to governance and compliance. The 2024 February deepfake fraud incident in Hong Kong is a case in point (Chen & Magramo, 2024). Even unexpected users can threaten the protection of data, which is manifested by examples of employees sharing confidential data with GenAI models. Industry reports from Forrester (2023), Cisco (2024), and the IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) have highlighted GenAI-induced risks to information assurance as a major threat to firms’ adoption and implementation of GenAI initiatives. Similar concerns have been acknowledged from a government perspective in the 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (White House, 2023b) and the 2023 congressional research report: Generative Artificial Intelligence and Data Privacy: A Primer (Congressional Research Service, 2023).",
        "Examples of how GenAI may exacerbate information assurance issues include: Sophisticated human-deception attacks, where cybercriminals can use GenAI to compromise businesses by writing targeted emails and creating deepfakes and voice clones; hallucination and confabulation, where GenAI creates seemingly correct information that is actually incorrect and may lead to security vulnerabilities; intellectual property theft, where GenAI creates materials that violate intellectual property rights; and challenges in regulation and compliance, where keeping GenAI models in check becomes increasingly difficult due to their complexity.",
        "Another source of threats to information assurance stems from attacks designed to target the way GenAI systems are trained and expected to be used. Many of these attacks can be mitigated by explicitly integrating information assurance considerations when designing GenAI systems. For example, GenAI tools may be subject to unreliable training data, data poisoning, security leaks, inference attacks, knowledge phishing, and prompt injections. These issues have put a spotlight on the need for new techniques to manage data and risks associated with GenAI.",
        "Cisco (2024) found that 92% of organizations “see GenAI as fundamentally different, requiring new techniques to manage data and risks.” The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls for actions on refining GenAI by mitigating information assurance issues (White House, 2023b). Worldwide efforts are being made on these fronts to protect LLMs against threats of information fabrication, system misuse, privacy breaches, etc. However, there are growing concerns that excessive focus and regulation on data security and privacy may stifle and slow the advancement of GenAI, especially in light of the European Union’s AI Act (Timis, 2023).",
        "The relationship between GenAI and information assurance is depicted below. Potential topics for this special issue include but are not limited to: What factors influence individuals’ security and privacy behavior in the presence of GenAI tools? How can we predict, analyze, and counteract the emerging threats to GenAI models? How can economic analysis contribute to combating information assurance threats in GenAI? What are the managerial strategies and their effectiveness in addressing GenAI-induced issues on data security and privacy? What are the key principles in attributing accountability and responsibilities for the risks in GenAI model output?",
        "By focusing on important research questions, this special issue will generate answers to address the NSF 10 Big Ideas (e.g., Future of Work and Harnessing the Data Revolution), NSF Focus Areas (e.g., Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity), National Academy of Engineering 14 Grand Challenges (e.g., Secure Cyberspace), and E.U. Strategies Priorities 2021-2027 (e.g., Cybersecurity). It also aligns with the national focus on exploring the intersection between AI and security (National Science Foundation, 2024). This special issue also connects with IS research streams, such as the Bright Internet. Finally, this special issue builds on the special issue by Mahmood et al. (2010) to address the new challenges posed by GenAI, including the bidirectional relationships between GenAI and information assurance."
