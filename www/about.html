    <h2 class="text-3xl py-4">What is Calls for Papers?</h2>
    <p class="py-2">Calls for Papers shows you the latest calls for papers of academic journals in your
        discipline.</p>
    <p class="py-2">Calls for papers for special issues in academic journals are currently published in
        several different
        locations. For example, calls for papers are distributed on mailing lists, on publisher websites, at
        conferences, and through personal networks. With several academic journals in a discipline and even
        more special issues, it can be incredibly difficult to keep track of calls for papers.</p>
    <p class="py-2"><strong>Calls for Papers solves this problem by collecting calls for papers and making
            them easily accessible in one location.</strong></p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl py-4">What journals does Calls for Papers cover?</h2>
    <p class="py-2">Calls for Papers currently covers the main journals of the Information Systems
        discipline.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl py-4">What is the source of your data and how accurate is it?</h2>
    <p class="py-2">Calls for Papers gets its data directly from the publishers' websites. The data is
        updated every 24 hours. This process runs automatically and relies on web scraping technologies
        which means that accuracy cannot be guaranteed. While we try to keep the data as up-to-date as
        possible, journals may change their publishers or publishers may change their website layout, all
        leading to potentially inaccurate data.</p>
