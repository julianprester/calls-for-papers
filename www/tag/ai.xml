    <p>Wave upon wave of digital technologies and the fast-advancing frontier of artificial intelligence (AI) are disrupting well-established, institutionalized ways of doing things, resulting in a host of ethical, regulatory, and policy challenges. The challenge involves addressing social, ecological, moral, and economic risks associated with technological advancements while, at the same time, encouraging competitiveness, innovation, and value generation from ubiquitous digital data. To address current ethical challenges and risks and anticipate future issues related to emerging technologies, governments are seeking to adjust regulations and set policy. Organizations are seeking to adapt their governance schemes to regulatory and ethical issues. This special issue seeks sociotechnical and information systems contributions to our thinking on ethics, regulation, and policy around digital technologies, data, and AI.</p>
    
    <p>Ethical tensions abound in relation to the pervasiveness of digital data and the widespread adoption of AI, including tensions between data privacy, fairness, and bias on the one hand, and business needs for using data for market and innovation purposes on the other. AI systems that increasingly replace cognitive tasks previously done by humans raise questions about deskilling and labor substitution and ultimately human dignity. While AI systems promise productivity gains and the potential to address key social and environmental issues, they also generate significant threats to sustainability and social challenges. Moreover, the responsibility of algorithms for the tasks they perform and the decisions they make is often not clear. The autonomy, interconnectedness, and increasing agency of digital technologies present challenges to established individualistic responsibility approaches since they make it difficult to attribute responsibility.</p>
    
    <p>The tension between addressing ethical risks and encouraging innovation requires balancing data privacy, fairness, and bias concerns with business needs for competitiveness and value generation from digital data and AI systems.</p>
    
    <p>Ethical challenges have inspired regulatory and policy action around digital technologies, particularly with respect to data and AI. The United States National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020 sets forth programs and activities and highlights values like trustworthiness; at the same time, it aims at creating competitive advantage for the US economy by creating an innovation ecosystem or fostering public-private partnership mechanisms. The European Union&#39;s AI Act embeds fundamental values as it seeks to accomplish a high level of protection of health, safety, and fundamental rights and defines requirements for transparency monitoring, market surveillance, and governance that provide legitimacy for the use of AI systems. Regulatory responses involve institutional construction and ongoing institutional change, often requiring the deliberate coordination and action of change agents at different levels, including political, corporate, or non-governmental individuals and groups. Rapid changes in the sociotechnical context fueled by the decentralized and immaterial nature of digital technologies require frequent updates and often render conventional approaches to setting regulation and policy slow and ineffective.</p>
    
    <p>Digital technologies serve a dual role—they are both the source of ethical concerns triggering regulatory change and a tool for implementing, monitoring, and updating policies and regulations, distinguishing regulation of technology from regulation through technology. Such tools help regulatory institutions achieve legitimacy and stability, which marks the distinction between regulation of technology and regulation through technology. Ethical challenges as well as policy and regulatory change require organizational efforts to adopt and comply with new regulations and policies. This is challenging, since it requires organizational actors to make sense of and interpret the often-complex changes in the regulatory institutional environment and demands changes in organizational practices as well as technology architecture and implementation.</p>

    <p>With the proliferation of the internet and mobile technology in the past two decades (Chen et al. 2002), online markets and platforms have experienced exponential growth and become a cornerstone of modern commerce, transforming how businesses operate and how consumers engage with products and services (Phan and Vogel 2010). The development of the online market attracted significant attention from academia.</p>
    
    <p>Meanwhile, driven by advances in models (including machine learning, deep learning, and large models) and computational power, artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping organizations and innovations (Fügener et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2023). The importance of AI goes beyond the improvement in operational performance, such as in personalization, recommendation, and data processing, and lies in the potential to solve complex problems with significant impacts (Wei et al. 2025). The term “transformative AI” was coined to refer to such potential of AI to change society, economy, or even humans (Banafa 2023; Trammell and Korinek 2023; Wessel et al. 2025).</p>
    
    <p>In particular, we posit that AI will bring transformative power to revolutionize the online market — a foundation of the digital economy. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise to unlock new opportunities, foster innovation, and address global challenges (Mikalef and Gupta 2021). With AI’s further integration into online markets, it may create a more dynamic, efficient, and customer-centric digital shopping experience (Deng et al. 2023; Rai et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2025).</p>
    
    <p>In light of this potential, this special issue invites efforts from information systems scholars to study the design, use, impact, and management of AI that may transform online markets for exchanging products, services, innovations, and algorithms, among other things. This special issue encourages research using technical, empirical, or behavioral methods performed at individual, group, organizational, or societal levels. We particularly welcome the studies that can bring insights into the future of AI in online markets.</p>

    <p>Digital threats continue to impede information assurance. Many issues in information assurance have arisen in the last decade or two, including risk management, information quality, intellectual property, privacy protection, compliance with regulations, and continuity of operations. As a result, protecting information has become a global priority, and collaborative efforts are being made to prevent, detect, and react to threats to information quality, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability.</p>
    
    <p>As society steps into the age of generative AI (GenAI), fresh challenges and opportunities are arising in the realms of information security, privacy, and quality. Questions have emerged regarding the role and intended/unintended consequences of GenAI in information assurance. GenAI is believed to pose a paradox, serving as a dual-edged sword in the realm of information assurance.</p>
    
    <p>The emergence of GenAI is poised to exert a profound impact on assurance. On the one hand, GenAI has been recognized for its ability to bolster information assurance and has the potential to strengthen business defenses, accelerate security processes, and identify emerging threats as they arise. On the other hand, GenAI heightens the potency of existing threats, allows the fabrication of false information, fuels intellectual property theft, and poses challenges to governance and compliance. The 2024 February deepfake fraud incident in Hong Kong is a case in point.</p>
    
    <p>Tremendous new opportunities exist for information systems scholars to study information assurance issues within the context of GenAI, as traditional approaches may not work. This special issue seeks research that goes beyond simple applications of existing theories and methods from the cybersecurity literature in IS. We invite studies that explore the unique information assurance challenges in the realm of GenAI, calling for the development and application of new theories or methods.</p>
