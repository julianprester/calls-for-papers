    <p>With the proliferation of the internet and mobile technology in the past two decades (Chen et al. 2002), online markets and platforms have experienced exponential growth and become a cornerstone of modern commerce, transforming how businesses operate and how consumers engage with products and services (Feng et al. 2024; Phan and Vogel 2010). The development of the online market attracted significant attention from academia. As technology continues to advance, the online market will become even more integral to the global economy, driving innovation and competition across industries and bringing operational efficiency.</p>
    
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, reshaping industries and redefining the boundaries of innovation and efficiency (Fügener et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2023; Noy and Zhang 2023). Its rapid development is driven by advances in models (including machine learning, deep learning, and large models) and computational power, enabling AI systems to perform complex tasks with unprecedented accuracy and speed. The importance of AI lies in its potential to solve complex problems, improve productivity, and drive economic growth (Wei et al. 2025). As a result, “Transformative AI” is coined to refer to AI systems that have the potential to cause a significant (often positive) impact on society, economy, or even humans (Banafa 2023; Wessel et al. 2025). Transformative AI refers to the effects the AI would have on humanity’s well-being, instead of specific capabilities the AI may have.</p>
    
    <p>As AI technologies continue to evolve, they promise to unlock new opportunities, foster innovation, and address global challenges (Mikalef and Gupta 2021). In particular, in online markets—a foundation of the digital economy—we posit that AI will bring transformative power to further enhance and even revolutionize the online market through enhancing personalization, optimizing operations, and improving human-platform interaction (Chen and Chan. 2024; Deng et al. 2023). With ongoing advancements, AI will further integrate into online markets, driving innovation and creating a more dynamic, efficient, and customer-centric digital shopping experience (Rai et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2025).</p>
    
    <p>In viewing this potential trend, this special issue calls for efforts from information systems and information management scholars on the study of the design, use, impact, and management of AI in online markets that may transform online markets that facilitate the exchange of products, services, innovations, and algorithms, among others. This special issue encourages research using different technical, empirical, or behavioral methods. We welcome research performed at the individual, group, organizational, and societal levels. We particularly welcome the studies that can bring insights to the future or AI in online markets, where the two powers join together.</p>

    <p>Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)—including generative and agentic forms—continues to reshape industries and societies, it remains largely devoid of human qualities, and today’s AI is often characterized as mechanistic and even &#39;sterile&#39;. Indeed, current AI design paradigms focus on maximizing efficiency, accuracy, and computational sophistication, often at the expense of embedding emotional, social, and ethical dimensions that are inherent in human interactions. While AI is effective in processing data and automating tasks, it is often impersonal, thus detaching from the human experience and undermining the adoption of AI.</p>
    
    <p>To address these shortcomings, AI development must be rethought toward an approach that emphasizes compassionate design by integrating ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, and emotional intelligence into the core design of AI systems. By embedding these principles, AI should not only be technically proficient but also capable of understanding and responding to the diverse needs of its human users to ensure that AI advances meaningfully contribute to humanity. The need for compassion-centered AI design has never been more pressing.</p>
    
    <p>Compassionate AI refers to systems that not only recognize human emotions and suffering but also proactively seek to alleviate distress, promote well-being, and uphold human dignity. Compassionate AI systems are envisioned as tools that complement human decision-making by providing support that is empathetic, inclusive, and contextually aware. Unlike empathy, which involves understanding others’ emotional states, or sympathy, which evokes feelings of sorrow, compassion combines emotional awareness with a purposeful intention to help other human beings.</p>
    
    <p>While AI has increased efficiency, personalization, and cost reduction in many settings, it has also raised ethical, legal, and societal concerns—particularly in high-stakes settings such as healthcare, education, crisis response, and social services. These concerns are magnified when AI systems, lacking moral agency, make decisions that affect vulnerable populations. In many applications—ranging from healthcare to finance and customer service—the absence of a humanistic perspective can result in interactions that feel mechanistic and unresponsive to the complexities of individual circumstances and propagate (or even amplify) existing societal biases.</p>
    
    <p>Compassionate AI addresses this challenge by embedding empathy, care, and contextual sensitivity into the design, deployment, and governance of AI systems. It envisions AI not as a mechanistic and utilitarian tool, but as a partner that embodies humanity’s highest moral aspirations. Ultimately, compassionate AI is both an ethical imperative and a catalyst—one that rehumanizes AI, ensuring that our AI-led future uplifts humanity, nurtures societal well-being, and reflects our collective commitment to a more empathetic and better world.</p>

    <p>Digital technologies, in particular artificial intelligence (AI), are reconfiguring how, where, and when work gets done, marking a shift from tools designed to support human tasks to agentic systems that collaborate with and even manage human workers. AI technologies are evolving to work autonomously or within hybrid collaboration systems of human and digital agents. Research on AI and human-AI collaboration has advanced from studying AI that supports human tasks to AI agents’ ability to make independent management decisions and regulate and manage human work. The future of working with AI is, however, still unknown and emergent, with both utopian and dystopian perspectives shaping our understanding of opportunities and challenges of their adoption and use in organizations, work, and other spheres of our lives.</p>
    
    <p>Prior research has helped make sense of and anticipate important side effects of AI-driven management, new forms of hidden and unrecognized ‘meta-work’ performed by employees, and the ‘ripple effects’ of introducing such technologies to the workplace. This includes the reconfiguration of spatial-temporal dimensions and ‘ways of seeing’ in the workplace, tensions between craft and mechanical work, and a wide range of unintended effects in work contexts such as loss of critical thinking and changes in how human work is coordinated as well as the authority and values that underpin it. New research is needed to develop relevant theories and methods to study human-AI collaboration and how this is reconfiguring work.</p>
    
    <p>This special issue invites submissions that critically examine the current and expected future effects of human-AI collaboration and other emerging digital work configurations. It seeks theoretical, empirical, and design-oriented contributions that study the transformative potential of digital-human collaboration, aiming to gather research that fosters ethical solutions and sustainable models for AI- and digitally-driven work, while informing future digital work scenarios. It encourages work that inspires innovative strategies and follows good research practice in the use of AI, but is also open to developing prospective scenarios and actively creating preferable futures.</p>
