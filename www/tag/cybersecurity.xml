    <p>Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) encompasses essential systems and services that are vital for societal stability, economic security, and national safety. The increasing digitalization of these infrastructures has introduced unprecedented efficiencies that have transformed economies, enabling faster service delivery, improved public safety, reduced corruption, and enhanced crisis response through data sharing and analytics.</p>
    
    <p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supports digital public infrastructure (DPI) as a driver for financial inclusion, social protection, and governance reforms. Digital advancements have also driven sustainability, with smart grids, environmental monitoring, and optimized resource management with potential for reducing carbon footprints and increasing resilience.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, technological innovation in financial services, transportation, and energy has the potential to stimulate economic growth through enabling new business models. While the increasing digitalization of Critical National Infrastructure has introduced efficiencies, it also created unprecedented vulnerabilities, including cyberattacks, cascading failures, and systemic interdependencies that amplify risks.</p>
    
    <p>Recognizing these challenges, governments in the UK, US, and Australia have developed regulatory frameworks such as the UK’s National Cyber Security Strategy, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) guidelines, and Australia’s Security of Critical Infrastructure Act (SOCI Act) to enhance resilience and mitigate emerging threats.</p>
    
    <p>CNI spans multiple critical sectors, each with unique security and operational challenges, including energy and utilities, telecommunications and information networks, financial services and payments, healthcare and public health, transportation and logistics, emergency services and law enforcement, and government and public sector infrastructure.</p>
    
    <p>As efforts to build CNIs have accelerated, issues around CNI security, resilience, and adaptability are becoming increasingly critical. At the same time significant research gaps remain in cybersecurity practices at the system level, governance, integration and management of emerging technologies such as Autonomous Driving Systems, and threat intelligence sharing.</p>
    
    <p>Addressing these gaps is essential for policymakers, businesses, and infrastructure operators to mitigate threats, optimize performance, and ensure long-term continuity.</p>
    
    <p>This Special Section aims to advance research on the design, adoption, and impact of digital solutions and services critical in building CNI to enhance governance, economic development, and public service delivery and safeguard CNI. We invite interdisciplinary contributions that explore how digital technologies and services can enhance CNI or impose new risks and challenges for the operation of CNIs. Papers that do not explicitly address or theorize about CNI design and operation and their digital components will be returned without review.</p>

    <p>Digital threats continue to impede information assurance. Many issues in information assurance have arisen in the last decade or two, including risk management, information quality, intellectual property, privacy protection, compliance with regulations, and continuity of operations (Mahmood et al., 2010; Forrest, 2023). As a result, protecting information has become a global priority, and collaborative efforts are being made to prevent, detect, and react to threats to information quality, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and availability (European Parliament, 2018; White House, 2023a). As society steps into the age of generative AI (GenAI) (Dennehy et. al., 2023), fresh challenges and opportunities are arising in the realms of information security, privacy, and quality. Questions have emerged regarding the role and intended/unintended consequences of GenAI in information assurance. GenAI is believed to pose a paradox, serving as a dual-edged sword in the realm of information assurance (Robidoux, 2024).</p>
    
    <p>GenAI creates new content, whereas traditional AI mostly makes predictions and classifications based on existing datasets. GenAI is designed to reason and operate independently across various domains, whereas traditional AI focuses on narrow tasks (e.g., playing chess and translating languages by following specific rules). In addition, GenAI works with multiple data modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos), whereas traditional AI primarily functions in a single mode of data. These new capabilities of GenAI open new possibilities for its applications in a wide range of areas. GenAI models can range from generalized models to domain-specific models that automate tasks and generate content adhering to industry-specific terminologies, context-specialized knowledge, and tailored experiences. Its power has sparked discussions on ethics and societal questions regarding the potential impact on employment, bias, privacy, and human-AI relationships.</p>
    
    <p>The emergence of GenAI is poised to exert a profound impact on assurance (Barrett et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). On the one hand, GenAI has been recognized for its ability to bolster information assurance. The IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) commented that GenAI has the potential to strengthen business defenses, accelerate security processes, and identify emerging threats as they arise. Studies have also noted that GenAI may be able to address information management challenges, including quality (Bhatti, 2024). On the other hand, GenAI heightens the potency of existing threats, allows the fabrication of false information, fuels intellectual property theft, and poses challenges to governance and compliance. The 2024 February deepfake fraud incident in Hong Kong is a case in point (Chen &amp; Magramo, 2024). Even unexpected users can threaten the protection of data, which is manifested by examples of employees sharing confidential data with GenAI models. Industry reports from Forrester (2023), Cisco (2024), and the IBM Institute for Business Value (2024) have highlighted GenAI-induced risks to information assurance as a major threat to firms’ adoption and implementation of GenAI initiatives. Similar concerns have been acknowledged from a government perspective in the 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (White House, 2023b) and the 2023 congressional research report: Generative Artificial Intelligence and Data Privacy: A Primer (Congressional Research Service, 2023).</p>
    
    <p>Examples of how GenAI may exacerbate information assurance issues include:</p>
    
    <p>1. **Sophisticated human-deception attacks:** Cybercriminals can use GenAI to compromise businesses by writing targeted emails. In addition, GenAI can create deepfakes and voice clones, resulting in “vishing” that uses phone calls and voice messages to trick people into sharing sensitive information.</p>
    
    <p>2. **Hallucination and confabulation:** GenAI is known to create incorrect information that is seemingly correct. In addition, attackers may trick GenAI into recommending unverified software code packages to unexpected users. When attackers embed malicious codes into packages endorsed by GenAI, users may unwittingly download and utilize these harmful codes, creating security vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation.</p>
    
    <p>3. **Intellectual property theft:** GenAI can create materials that violate intellectual property rights. For example, GenAI can create content that resembles existing copyrighted materials, resulting in legal ramifications and conflicts.</p>
    
    <p>4. **Challenges in regulation and compliance:** Keeping GenAI models in check is subject to considerable hurdles because of how intricate and swiftly they evolve. Ensuring compliance with data protection laws and standards will become increasingly difficult as GenAI becomes more autonomous and capable of making independent decisions.</p>
    
    <p>Another source of threats to information assurance stems from attacks that are designed to target the way GenAI systems are trained and expected to be used. Many of these attacks can be mitigated by explicitly integrating information assurance considerations when designing GenAI systems. For example, GenAI tools may be subject to:</p>
    
    <p>1. **Unreliable training data:** A substantial amount of training data is employed in constructing large language models (LLMs). Yet this data may be of low quality and is often unverified. The security of the models is influenced by the quality of the training data, paving the way for potential vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and compromises regarding sensitive information.</p>
    
    <p>2. **Data poisoning:** GenAI needs to be trained and tuned on inputs and outputs. Data poisoning occurs when inputs are manipulated to alter or corrupt the training data in LLMs, which consequently impacts the desired outputs of the overall system.</p>
    
    <p>3. **Security leaks, inference attacks, and knowledge phishing:** Security leaks in the context of GenAI refer to the unintended disclosure of sensitive information embedded within a model itself or through its responses. This is also known as inference attacks or knowledge phishing.</p>
    
    <p>4. **Prompt injections:** Prompt injections occur when malicious inputs are provided to an AI system to manipulate its output or to execute unintended actions.</p>
    
    <p>Cisco (2024) found that 92% of organizations “see GenAI as fundamentally different, requiring new techniques to manage data and risks.” The 2023 U.S. Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence calls for actions on refining GenAI by mitigating information assurance issues (White House, 2023b). Worldwide efforts are being made on these fronts to protect LLMs against threats of information fabrication, system misuse, privacy breaches, etc. Gartner recommends mitigation strategies, which include “establishing a governance entity and workflow, monitoring and blocking access, communicating acceptable use policies, exploring prompt engineering and API integrations, and prioritizing private hosting options” (Robidoux, 2024). However, there are growing concerns that excessive focus and regulation on data security and privacy may stifle and slow the advancement of GenAI, especially in terms of the European Union’s AI Act (Timis, 2023).</p>
