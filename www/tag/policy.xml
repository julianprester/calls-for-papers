    <p>Wave upon wave of digital technologies and the fast-advancing frontier of artificial intelligence (AI) are disrupting well-established, institutionalized ways of doing things (Bailey et al., 2022), resulting in a host of ethical, regulatory, and policy challenges (Yoo et al., 2010). The challenge involves addressing social, ecological, moral, and economic risks associated with technological advancements (Elliot, 2011) while, at the same time, encouraging competitiveness, innovation, and value generation from ubiquitous digital data (Alaimo &amp; Kallinikos, 2024). To address current ethical challenges and risks and anticipate future issues related to emerging technologies, governments are seeking to adjust regulations (Bennett Moses, 2017) and set policy (King &amp; Kraemer, 2019). Organizations are seeking to adapt their governance schemes to regulatory (De Vaujany et al., 2018; Lanamäki et al., 2025) and ethical (Pang et al., 2024) issues. This special issue seeks sociotechnical and information systems contributions to our thinking on ethics, regulation, and policy around digital technologies, data, and AI.</p>
    
    <p>Ethical tensions abound in relation to the pervasiveness of digital data and the widespread adoption of AI, including tensions between data privacy, fairness, and bias on the one hand, and business needs for using data for market and innovation purposes on the other. AI systems that increasingly replace cognitive tasks previously done by humans raise questions about deskilling and labor substitution (Berente et al., 2021) and ultimately human dignity (Leidner &amp; Tona, 2021). While AI systems promise productivity gains and the potential to address key social and environmental issues, they also generate significant threats to sustainability and social challenges. Moreover, the responsibility of algorithms for the tasks they perform and the decisions they make is often not clear (Martin, 2019). The autonomy, interconnectedness, and increasing agency of digital technologies present challenges to established individualistic responsibility approaches since they make it difficult to attribute responsibility (de Vaujany et al., 2025).</p>
    
    <p>Ethical challenges have inspired regulatory and policy action around digital technologies, particularly with respect to data and AI (Smuha, 2021). The United States National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020 sets forth programs and activities and highlights values like trustworthiness; at the same time, it aims at creating competitive advantage for the US economy by aiming at creating an innovation ecosystem or fostering public-private partnership mechanisms. The European Union&#39;s AI Act embeds fundamental values as it seeks to accomplish &quot;a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights&quot; and defines requirements for transparency monitoring, market surveillance, governance that provide legitimacy for the use of AI systems. In addition, it seeks to promote innovation by means of regulatory sandboxes to foster innovation. The tension between data privacy and use, for instance, is reflected in the General Data Protection (GDPR) which builds on privacy as a fundamental value.</p>
    
    <p>Regulatory responses involve institutional construction and ongoing institutional change, often requiring the deliberate coordination and action of change agents at different levels, including political, corporate, or non-governmental individuals and groups (Gornitzka &amp; Sverdrup, 2008; Rasmussen &amp; Toshkov, 2013). These actors need to make sense of emerging technologies and their prospects to create policy and to regulate them (Seidel et al., 2025). Rapid changes in the sociotechnical context fueled by the decentralized and immaterial nature of digital technologies require frequent updates and often render conventional approaches to setting regulation and policy slow and ineffective (Beaumier et al., 2020). This development has given rise to a move from established frameworks that focus on sanctioning undesired behaviors through stable, well-established structures, to regulatory and policy-focused frameworks that allow for more frequent updates (Brownsword et al., 2017) and results in novel approaches to ensuring ethical technological advancement (Berente et al., 2024).</p>
    
    <p>Digital technologies serve a dual role—they are both the source of ethical concerns triggering regulatory change and a tool for implementing, monitoring, and updating policies and regulations, distinguishing &quot;regulation of technology&quot; from &quot;regulation through technology.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Aside from command-and-control government regulation, other regulatory approaches include market regulation such as through contracts, as well as self-regulation, the &quot;practice of industry taking the initiative to formulate and enforce rules and codes of conduct&quot; (Black, 2001, p. 116). Such soft-law approaches consist of &quot;non-binding norms of action, process, and behaviour, for whom sanctions of the formal regulatory type play no part&quot; (Marsden, 2012, p. 118). Beyond merely complying with regulations, many organizations are seeking to internalize ethical approaches to the governance of powerful digital technologies (Schiff et al., 2020). Rules can even be implemented in software (Lessig, 2000) and thus allow for new forms of algorithmic regulation (Yeung, 2018), highlighting how technology can be a carrier of institutional elements (Berente &amp; Seidel, 2022).</p>
    
    <p>Clearly, digital technology is not only an external agent that raises ethical concerns and triggers regulatory change. As a tool and agent, digital technologies can serve to implement, monitor, and update policies and regulations (Brownsword et al., 2017; De Vaujany et al., 2018). Such tools help regulatory institutions achieve legitimacy and stability—for instance, when &quot;regtech&quot; monitors the implementation of a regulation (Anagnostopoulos, 2018), when smart contracts prevent post-hoc changes (Halaburda et al., 2024), or when a system&#39;s architecture prevents certain uses or nudges users towards preferred uses (Yeung, 2019). Technology is not only the source of unanticipated challenges, but can also be part of the solution for regulatory problems (Brownsword et al., 2017), which marks the distinction between &quot;regulation of technology&quot; and &quot;regulation through technology&quot; (Butler et al., 2023).</p>
    
    <p>Of course, ethical challenges as well as policy and regulatory change require organizational efforts to adopt and comply with new regulations and policies (Butler et al., 2023; Lanamäki et al., 2025). This is challenging, since it requires organizational actors to make sense of and interpret the often-complex changes in the regulatory institutional environment and demands changes in organizational practices as well as technology architecture and implementation. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and subsequent European data regulations have had profound organizational impacts related to the implementation of technical solutions, adjustments of organizational structure, and strategic considerations about minimal compliance and full adoption (Jakobi et al., 2020). Further, organizations are not necessarily passive recipients of regulatory change and new policies, but they respond to regulatory pressures in different ways and actively take positions to influence and shape regulations and policy.</p>
