    <p>Wave upon wave of digital technologies and the fast-advancing frontier of artificial intelligence (AI) are disrupting well-established, institutionalized ways of doing things (Bailey et al., 2022), resulting in a host of ethical, regulatory, and policy challenges (Yoo et al., 2010). The challenge involves addressing social, ecological, moral, and economic risks associated with technological advancements (Elliot, 2011) while, at the same time, encouraging competitiveness, innovation, and value generation from ubiquitous digital data (Alaimo &amp; Kallinikos, 2024). To address current ethical challenges and risks and anticipate future issues related to emerging technologies, governments are seeking to adjust regulations (Bennett Moses, 2017) and set policy (King &amp; Kraemer, 2019). Organizations are seeking to adapt their governance schemes to regulatory (De Vaujany et al., 2018; Lanamäki et al., 2025) and ethical (Pang et al., 2024) issues. This special issue seeks sociotechnical and information systems contributions to our thinking on ethics, regulation, and policy around digital technologies, data, and AI.</p>
    
    <p>Ethical tensions abound in relation to the pervasiveness of digital data and the widespread adoption of AI, including tensions between data privacy, fairness, and bias on the one hand, and business needs for using data for market and innovation purposes on the other. AI systems that increasingly replace cognitive tasks previously done by humans raise questions about deskilling and labor substitution (Berente et al., 2021) and ultimately human dignity (Leidner &amp; Tona, 2021). While AI systems promise productivity gains and the potential to address key social and environmental issues, they also generate significant threats to sustainability and social challenges. Moreover, the responsibility of algorithms for the tasks they perform and the decisions they make is often not clear (Martin, 2019). The autonomy, interconnectedness, and increasing agency of digital technologies present challenges to established individualistic responsibility approaches since they make it difficult to attribute responsibility (de Vaujany et al., 2025).</p>
    
    <p>Ethical challenges have inspired regulatory and policy action around digital technologies, particularly with respect to data and AI (Smuha, 2021). The United States National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020 sets forth programs and activities and highlights values like trustworthiness; at the same time, it aims at creating competitive advantage for the US economy by aiming at creating an innovation ecosystem or fostering public-private partnership mechanisms. The European Union&#39;s AI Act embeds fundamental values as it seeks to accomplish &quot;a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights&quot; and defines requirements for transparency monitoring, market surveillance, governance that provide legitimacy for the use of AI systems. In addition, it seeks to promote innovation by means of regulatory sandboxes to foster innovation. The tension between data privacy and use, for instance, is reflected in the General Data Protection (GDPR) which builds on privacy as a fundamental value.</p>
    
    <p>Regulatory responses involve institutional construction and ongoing institutional change, often requiring the deliberate coordination and action of change agents at different levels, including political, corporate, or non-governmental individuals and groups (Gornitzka &amp; Sverdrup, 2008; Rasmussen &amp; Toshkov, 2013). These actors need to make sense of emerging technologies and their prospects to create policy and to regulate them (Seidel et al., 2025). Rapid changes in the sociotechnical context fueled by the decentralized and immaterial nature of digital technologies require frequent updates and often render conventional approaches to setting regulation and policy slow and ineffective (Beaumier et al., 2020). This development has given rise to a move from established frameworks that focus on sanctioning undesired behaviors through stable, well-established structures, to regulatory and policy-focused frameworks that allow for more frequent updates (Brownsword et al., 2017) and results in novel approaches to ensuring ethical technological advancement (Berente et al., 2024).</p>
    
    <p>Digital technologies serve a dual role—they are both the source of ethical concerns triggering regulatory change and a tool for implementing, monitoring, and updating policies and regulations, distinguishing &quot;regulation of technology&quot; from &quot;regulation through technology.&quot;</p>
    
    <p>Aside from command-and-control government regulation, other regulatory approaches include market regulation such as through contracts, as well as self-regulation, the &quot;practice of industry taking the initiative to formulate and enforce rules and codes of conduct&quot; (Black, 2001, p. 116). Such soft-law approaches consist of &quot;non-binding norms of action, process, and behaviour, for whom sanctions of the formal regulatory type play no part&quot; (Marsden, 2012, p. 118). Beyond merely complying with regulations, many organizations are seeking to internalize ethical approaches to the governance of powerful digital technologies (Schiff et al., 2020). Rules can even be implemented in software (Lessig, 2000) and thus allow for new forms of algorithmic regulation (Yeung, 2018), highlighting how technology can be a carrier of institutional elements (Berente &amp; Seidel, 2022).</p>
    
    <p>Clearly, digital technology is not only an external agent that raises ethical concerns and triggers regulatory change. As a tool and agent, digital technologies can serve to implement, monitor, and update policies and regulations (Brownsword et al., 2017; De Vaujany et al., 2018). Such tools help regulatory institutions achieve legitimacy and stability—for instance, when &quot;regtech&quot; monitors the implementation of a regulation (Anagnostopoulos, 2018), when smart contracts prevent post-hoc changes (Halaburda et al., 2024), or when a system&#39;s architecture prevents certain uses or nudges users towards preferred uses (Yeung, 2019). Technology is not only the source of unanticipated challenges, but can also be part of the solution for regulatory problems (Brownsword et al., 2017), which marks the distinction between &quot;regulation of technology&quot; and &quot;regulation through technology&quot; (Butler et al., 2023).</p>
    
    <p>Of course, ethical challenges as well as policy and regulatory change require organizational efforts to adopt and comply with new regulations and policies (Butler et al., 2023; Lanamäki et al., 2025). This is challenging, since it requires organizational actors to make sense of and interpret the often-complex changes in the regulatory institutional environment and demands changes in organizational practices as well as technology architecture and implementation. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and subsequent European data regulations have had profound organizational impacts related to the implementation of technical solutions, adjustments of organizational structure, and strategic considerations about minimal compliance and full adoption (Jakobi et al., 2020). Further, organizations are not necessarily passive recipients of regulatory change and new policies, but they respond to regulatory pressures in different ways and actively take positions to influence and shape regulations and policy.</p>

    <p>The rise of information technology (IT) in organizations has been an inherent part of an agenda to increase and shape forms of social control. Despite the inherent link between uses of IT and social control, the topic of regulation has not received significant attention in the information system field – neither theoretically nor empirically. This special issue seeks to address this gap.</p>
    
    <p>The issue explores the growing and significant interplay between IT and regulation in the age of digitalization, where new challenges with social control with IT are emerging. In this special issue, we are interested in two broad domains of research related to regulation and IT: regulation through IT and regulation of IT.</p>
    
    <p>The first domain – regulation through IT – concerns new forms and arenas of regulation enacted through innovative IT solutions (often called “RegTech”). These technologies which are increasingly implicated in regulatory practices include new forms of real-time big data analytics, machine learning and other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, use of blockchains and distributed ledgers, Internet of Things solutions or natural language processing techniques. These technologies change the ways organizations and industrial sectors respond to and comply with a growing number of regulatory obligations and needs. These technologies are also driving changes in the ways in which regulators seek to supervise and monitor firms and the ways in which firms comply with laws and regulations. Greater market and organizational transparency and enhanced supervision are now advocated as critical responses to organizational misconduct and associated risks. This has resulted in an increasing call for bureaucratization and (over-) regulation. Call for greater monitoring, supervision and sanctioning have been driven by concerns regarding the environment, health and safety risks, corporate fiscal and fiduciary scandals, financial failures leading to financial crisis in 2007-2008, or growing violations of data privacy that increased the “volume, velocity and variety” of laws and regulations that organizations must comply with and the range of novel IT based solutions they need to comply to such demands. Regulators have also shown a growing appetite to measure performance, to quantify financial, regulatory and operational risk and to improve compliance reporting through new technologies that assign accountability, enforce security and behavioural control, automate monitoring and enhance record keeping.</p>
    
    <p>The second domain – regulation of IT – is the wide range deployment and associated regulatory effects of new IT (especially concerns of security, privacy and/or safety). There is a notable gap in the field’s knowledge regarding new demands and ways of regulating IT (e.g., social media) given its scale, complexity and pervasive use. Concerns regarding the pervasive effects of platform businesses on privacy, competition and information veracity have invited calls to control and scrutinize technology vendors. Similar issues are likely to emerge in autonomous cars, user-based insurance, health policies and so on. There are consequently increased demands to regulate various IT solutions and to increase regulatory powers of governments related to IT uses, including through introducing entirely new regulatory bodies. If platform providers and vendors, or organizations offering extensive algorithmic solutions as parts of their related services, are subjected to new regulatory structures, then important questions arise regarding what degrees of transparency and reporting are appropriate and how related forms of supervision and sanctioning would function that need to regulate actual systems and their functioning and those who are implicated in their design.</p>
    
    <p>We invite empirical and theoretical research that contribute to our understanding and application how regulation is enacted through IT or how uses of IT can be regulated. We encourage submissions that use diverse epistemological and methodological approaches to focus on emerging and new regulatory solutions and practices. Submissions may engage in cross-disciplinary inquiries and should offer novel knowledge and fresh methodological, theoretical and empirical insights how regulation and IT evolve and are related. The papers will be evaluated for their interestingness, novelty and credibility of the contribution. If in doubt, interested authors should consult the special issue guest editors whether their papers fall within the scope of the special issue. To this end, authors are encouraged to submit an extended abstract to the editors for initial feedback.</p>
